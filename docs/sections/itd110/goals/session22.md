## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
As usual, we'll start class with a reading quiz. See the previous class for details on the reading assignment.

### Images, relative and absolute paths
Today, we'll focus on how to embed images into your HTML pages. We'll have a little discussion about how paths work in HTML.



### Image Practice

Add a picture of yourself to your `index.html` page. Follow these steps:

- First, make a new directory in your repo called `images`
- Select the image that you would like to include, and produce at least three different versions. [Follow these instructions to reduce your image's file size](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/crop-resize-or-rotate-an-image-prvw2015/mac#:~:text=image's%20file%20size-,Go%20to%20the%20Preview%20app%20on%20your%20Mac.,value%20in%20the%20Resolution%20field.). Use these file sizes:
    - small (320 √ó 240 pixels)
    - medium (640 √ó 480 pixels)
    - large (1024 √ó 768 pixels)
- Give each of these files reasonable names and add them to your `images` folder.
- Add this image to your index.html file, and use the srcset attribute to link the alternate versions.
