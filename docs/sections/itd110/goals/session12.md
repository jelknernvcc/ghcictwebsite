## Prepare for Guest Speaker
We will have a guest speaker next class - Sara Daniel, the 'webmaster' who runs all of APS's websites (eg [Arlington Tech](https://arlingtontech.apsva.us/)). Ms. Daniel will tell us about what it means to be a webmaster, the most important features for any website to have, and why APS uses a tool called Wordpress to manage the content on our websites. To prepare for this presentation:
- [Explore the Wordpress website to learn more about it](https://wordpress.org/)
- Spend some time clicking around APS's websites (Arlington Tech, [the central APS website](https://www.apsva.us/), or any other APS school you feel connected to)
- Write down three questions that you have for Ms. Daniel, and bring them with you to class. The questions can be about career, technical questions about websites, or anything else you think is relevant. I'll count this as a participation grade.
