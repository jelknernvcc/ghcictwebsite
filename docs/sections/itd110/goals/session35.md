## New (sort of) Unit
We'll spend the next few weeks, wrapping up ITD110, playing with our new web development skills, and preparing for the final exam.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Prepare for the final exam
We'll have our final exam on:
- Friday (A Day)
- Monday (B Day)

Our final exam will be cumulative of **everything** we've done this semester. Because there's so much content, it'll be a bit longer than our previous tests:
- 30 multiple choice questions
- 3 free response questions
- 70 minutes

You can expect these questions to be very similar to the four unit tests that we've had... you might even recognize some of the questions ðŸ˜‰. So the best way to prepare is to review your previous tests. You should also go back through the content on this website to make sure you remember what we've learned.

As always, you're allowed to bring one sheet of hand-written notes. 


### Course Evaluations
<p style="color: red;">
Please complete your course evaluations. To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

### Top Chef (A Day)

With the folks at your table, you'll design and create a menu website for a themed restaurant. You'll randomly draw your theme.

First - work with your table to hand-draw a menu. Decide how your menu should be divided into categories, how those categories should be laid out on the page, and then come up with a few menu items for each category.

Once your group has agreed on a page design, everyone should implement the page themselves.

At the end of the time, select one group member to share.

Use this activity to practice:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS Selectors
- Grid layouts
- Color palettes
- Font selection

### CSS Grid Pixel Art (B Day)
One fun way to practice with CSS grid and selectors is to create pixel art - you can create a square grid and use selectors to individually color selected squares.

For today's classwork grade, make some nice pixel art using this technique. You can [see some nice examples here](https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-css-pixel-art/), and [I wrote some starter code for you here](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/art_example.html)

Commit your code to your repo before the final exam!

### Redesign a website's CSS (B Day)

We'll play in class with a fun CSS extension called [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/), which allows you to write your own CSS for existing websites. The easiest way to install it is via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)

For this assignment, you'll choose a website and add custom styles to it. You'll need to spend some time reading the source code for the website to identify which elements you want to style, and then write custom CSS for them.

You should:
- Add your own colors
- Change the font (probably easiest to use a web-safe font here)
- Use the box model to change the size/position of some elements
- If you want an extra challenge: Find an element that has a bunch of sub-elements, and turn that element into a custom grid

To submit this assignment, commit your custom CSS to your repo, and write a new Markdown journal entry. Include a screenshot of your version of the page, and a link to your custom CSS script.

This is also due before the final exam!
