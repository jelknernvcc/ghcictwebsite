# Project Instructions

## Introduction
For this project, you will come up with your own fictitious business, and then create a Wordpress website to promote your business.

In class, we learned about Wordpress, a content management system (“CMS”) that allows non-technical users to create websites, with a focus on the web content instead of coding. We learned that Wordpress is the most popular CMS, and is the CMS that our school system uses for all of its websites.

The goal of this project is for you to develop an understanding of and appreciation for the importance of content and organization in a website. You’ll also get a chance to reflect on the ways that different businesses represent themselves on their websites (for example, how is a website for a restaurant different from a website for a bike shop?).

## Procedure
First, you should decide what kind of business you are creating. Before you start building your website, identify at least three similar businesses that actually exist here in Arlington, and examine their websites (for example, if your business is a beauty salon, study the websites of three real beauty salons in Arlington). Spend some time looking at how they present themselves and the kind of information that they include. You will write about these three businesses in your reflection.

We will use Wordpress.com for this project. Wordpress.com allows you to create and publish a sample Wordpress website for free. We will go over the steps to create a new website on Wordpress.com together in class. You can also review those steps here: [Wordpress Quick Start Guide](https://wordpress.com/learn/courses/getting-started/quick-start-guide/) (note: Wordpress.com has paid plans and occasionally encourages free users to upgrade. You can complete this project with the free account – you do not need to pay or provide any payment information).

Your website should have:

- An appropriate, attractive theme, and a menu bar that links to each page on the site
- Four total pages:
    - A homepage that introduces your business
    - An “about us” page that includes your business’s name, location, hours, and contact information
    - A page that explains the services or products that your business offers
    - One other page of your choice

Each page must have a title, some text, and at least one relevant picture. Although the business you are creating is fictional, it is important that you don’t plagiarize - all text must be your own. You may use photos from elsewhere on the internet, but always include a caption that explains where you found the picture.

## Reflection
You will also write a two-paragraph reflection for this assignment. The first paragraph should include links to the three real-world businesses whose websites you studied. You should reflect on the unique aspects of how these kinds of businesses present themselves through their websites, and how you reflected those aspects in your website (eg – If you looked at websites for restaurants and noticed that all three included information about dietary restrictions, you should add a similar section to your own website). The second paragraph should describe your experience working with Wordpress – what elements of Wordpress did you find helpful, and which did you find challenging?

## Submission Instructions
This project is due by the beginning of class on:
- A day: Wednesday, October 30
- B day: Friday, October 25

We will be presenting our websites in class that day, so late submissions cannot be accepted.

You will submit this project by adding an entry to your class journal. The journal entry should include two parts:

- A link to your Wordpress.com website. Your page will actually be available on the internet, so I should be able to click on the link to see your website. Make sure your page is officially published before submitting. Try to open your page’s URL in your phone’s browser – if you can’t see it, I won’t be able to see it either.
- Your reflection.

## Grading Rubric
This project will count as a summative assessment and will be equal to the unit 1 test.
The grade will be assigned on a 12-point scale, using the rubric below.

| Assessment Criteria        | Meets Expectations - 3 points                           | Partially Meets Expectations - 2 points                  | Does Not Meet Expectations - 1 point                      | Not Present - 0 points                                   |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Website theme and organization | Website applies a reasonable theme, and has consistent use of colors, fonts, and photos. | Website applies a reasonable theme, but some of the colors, fonts, or photos are inconsistent with the theme. | Theme is not reasonable for the business (eg a restaurant website has a header that says “Welcome to my blog!”), or colors, fonts, or photos are distractingly inconsistent. | No theme or styling is applied.                           |
| Website content             | All of the expected content is available and easy to access on the website. | Most of the expected content is available on the website, but some is missing and/or hard to find. | Very little of the expected content is provided.           | Only template content is included.                       |
| Website quality             | Photos render correctly, all links work as expected, and all template text is removed. | Website is mostly functional, but contains a few broken links, missing photos, or template text. | Technical errors make it challenging to navigate the website or find information. | The website is entirely unreachable.                     |
| Reflection                  | Identifies three real-world websites and analyzes distinct characteristics of the type of business selected. Reflects on the experience using Wordpress in the project. | Reflection is thorough but describes the websites and does not compare/contrast to identify features unique to the chosen business type. | Some reflection is provided, but does not sufficiently address any of the prompts. | Reflection not provided or does not answer any of the prompts. |
