## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- ðŸ¤« Be able to encode and decode cryptographically secure secret messages using asymmetric encryption
- ðŸ“– Have a well-organized Github repo, and a journal linked from your homepage

### Today's Vocabulary:
- Encryption
- Symmetric / Asymmetric
- Public / Private Key
- Encode / Decode

## What We'll Do In Class
I'm using today as a bit of a reset. We'll catch up on some loose ends from the past few classes.

### Check on your repo and StudentVue
- Check on your StudentVue. Do you have any assignments missing? If so, don't assume that I'll notice them. Send me an email!
- Your github repo should contain: One Markdown journal entry, the mkdir quiz from [Session 4](session.html?num=10), an animal name.

### Activity - Asymmetric Encryption
This didn't go great last time. I've totally rewritten the instructions and I'd like to try again.

[Follow the instructions here](../projects/project.html?id=01ssh_messages)

### Github repo organization
We'll all work together to add some features to our Github websites. Our goal will be to have a nicely-organized journal that is linked from our Github homepages.

## Homework

### Send me an Email
Everyone has a NOVA email address now! I'll stop accepting emails at the end of this week, so go back to [Session 2](./session.html?num=02) and complete the email assignment if you haven't!

### Journal
Add a README.md file to your rsa_encryption_activity. In this file, use Markdown to answer these prompts:
- What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
- Explain the steps of the encryption and decryption process
- Why is it important that you never share your secret key?

This journal entry, and the files in your rsa_encryption_activity repo, are due by the beginning of next class. I'll count this as a quiz grade.

### Reading
Next class, we'll wrap up our unit on the internet by learning about internet applications. Read pages 73-80 in [our networking textbook](https://do1.dr-chuck.net/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf) and prepare for a reading quiz next class.

### Start preparing for our first test
We'll have our first test next week. This will cover everything that we've done this year - the terminal tools and the internet. I'll have a better study guide for you next class. In the meantime, start going through the previous lessons to jog your memory.
