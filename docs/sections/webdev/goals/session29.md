### <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">No Reading Quiz</span>

<div style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">
As promised, no reading quiz today. But I hope you enjoyed the youtube video about fonts, and that you came away with a general appreciation for the power that fonts have to convey meaning and emotion.

Instead of our reading quiz, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVhlJNJopOQ">we'll watch this youtube video</a>

<br><br>
The study of fonts goes deep, but we'll keep it very simple today.

If you want to learn more rules and techniques for selecting the best font for your website <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXxI0fLtQyE&list=PLaC4Y-Cy7tlhQA_YM8PUGcgtG9KNtdHFZ">I really like this series on Youtube</a>

### <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">Font Review</span>

<div style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">
We'll review the details about fonts that I do want you to know:
<ul>
<li>Fonts vs Typefaces</li>
<li>Serifs, x-heights, ascenders/descenders, spacing, and kerning</li>
<li>Web-safe fonts</li>
<li>Font families</li>

</div>



### <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">Exploration</span>

<div style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">
To play around with fonts, return to either the zoo or the library websites that we worked on earlier this unit. Find reasonable places to apply each of these techniques:
<ul>
<li>Add at least two different reasonable fonts, and be sure to provide a good backup font stack for each. <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/web-safe-fonts/">See this website for a nice list of web-safe fonts</a></li>
<li>Use the text-align property at least two times</li>
<li>Use the text-transform property at least once</li>

You may need to add some div/span elements to help apply these styles.

### <span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">Reading</span>


<div style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', Arial, sans-serif;">
Next week, we'll play with web page layout using the CSS Grid. I don't love the way that this is explained in the edube text, so instead I'd like you to read <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/">this page</a>. Only read through the section called "grid construction." Be sure to go through this slowly and take time to understand the examples! We'll start our next class with a reading quiz.
