## Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should:
- Understand the key differences between TCP and UDP
- Know when to use TCP vs UDP in network communication
- Understand how the binary number system works
- Be able to convert binary to decimal and vice versa
- Create and interpret binary representations of letters

### Today's Vocabulary:
- TCP / UDP
- Positional Number System
- Binary ("base 2") / Decimal ("base 10")
- ASCII

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As usual, we'll start with a reading quiz to make sure you're comfortable with the concepts that you read about for homework.

### TCP vs UDP
Today, we'll start by discussing the key differences between TCP and UDP and why each is used for different types of network communication (see the reading from Session 7 if you need a refresher).

We'll also learn more about the Internet Protocol by playing with the `traceroute` command in the terminal. You can play with an online, visual version of this command here: [geotraceroute](https://geotraceroute.com/).


### Binary

Next, we'll dive into the [binary number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number). We'll construct a , a simple tool that you can use for converting binary to decimal. 

Then we'll discuss how other types of information are represented in binary. And Weâ€™ll do some fun activities to practice with these concepts.

Here are some relevant resources for this section:
- See the video from Session 7's reading if you need an introduction to binary
- [Flippy-Do](https://csunplugged.org/en/topics/binary-numbers/unit-plan/making-a-flippy-do/)
- [Binary Game](https://learningcontent.cisco.com/games/binary/index.html)
- [ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com/) (make sure to only use the Dec column).

### Key Topics:
- TCP vs UDP: Differences and Uses
- Binary Number System
- ASCII Table for reference: [ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com/)
- [Bracelet Knot Instructions](https://makeandfable.com/2020/01/simple-sliding-knot/)

## Homework

### Binary Practice

Continue practicing binary-to-decimal conversions using the Binary Game. Make sure you're comfortable with the conversions - we'll have a quiz on binary to decimal at the beginning of next class. You **will** be allowed to use your flippy-do on the quiz.

### Read about Internet Security

Next class will be about internet security. To prepare for that class, read the first section about internet security in [our networks textbook here](https://do1.dr-chuck.net/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf). Read pages 89-92 (no need to read section 8.3). We'll include a few questions about this on the quiz next class.
