## Lesson Objectives
Welcome back! Today we'll do a bit of review, and we'll discuss the schedule for the next few weeks.


## What We'll Do In Class

## Course Evaluations
<p style="color: red;">
Please complete your course evaluations. To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

## Restaurant Menu Design Challenge

With the folks at your table, design and create a menu website for a themed restaurant. You'll randomly draw your theme.

First - work with your table to hand-draw a menu. Decide how your menu should be divided into categories, how those categories should be laid out on the page, and then come up with a few menu items for each category.

Once your group has agreed on a page design, everyone should implement the page themselves.

At the end of the time, select one group member to share.

Use this activity to practice:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS Selectors
- Grid layouts
- Color palettes
- Font selection

## Test Prep
Next class we'll have our unit 4 test. Take some time in class today to review the content that we've learned this unit and make a cheat sheet!

Specifically, make sure that you review the readings in edube. Some of the content that we learned this unit is tricky - so make sure you review:
- Selectors (we've only done element, class, and id selectors)
- Cascade and Specificity Rules
- Box Model

Here are a few specific topics we highlighted that you should be comfortable with:
- Colors
- `background-clip` to control which parts of the box model get the background color
- properties of fonts
- Text formatting properties (text-align and text-transform)

## Polish your project
I'll start grading them at 3pm today!
