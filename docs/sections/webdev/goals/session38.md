Happy last day of ITD110! 

I'll take a few minutes at the beginning of class to celebrate everything that
we've learned this semester, and then we'll preview everything that we're going
to learn next semester.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Semester 2 Preview

When we return from the long weekend, we'll have a new course website for
ITD210. In the meantime, [you can preview the syllabus
here](../../itd210/info/S_25_ITD210.pdf)

We'll spend the first bit of ITD210 working toward our certification exam. My
goal is that we'll complete the certification by the end of Q3. To start working
toward this goal, we'll do a thorough review of [the exam syllabus
here](https://js.institute/wde-exam-syllabus).

### Dynamic Websites

Our first topic for the new class will be web forms. Before we dive into forms, 
we'll have a quick discussion of static vs dynamic websites and the
request/response cycle. We'll discuss two types of web requests, 
[GET and POST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods), and when we use each.

### Find some forms

We'll practice finding some forms online that use GET requests and that use POST requests

### Reading - HTML Forms

Your first reading assignment of the year is about forms. We'll start next class
with a reading quiz about forms, and we'll practice making and styling some
forms.

This reading assignment is back in the HTML course and is called 
[Essentials of HTML Forms](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/essentials-of-html-forms-1)
