## Lesson Objectives
Welcome back! Today we'll do a bit of review, and we'll discuss the schedule for the next few weeks.


## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
I'm sure you have been thinking about CSS a ton over the last 20 days! Just in case, we'll start class with a quick, fun, review game

## Upcoming Schedule
Including today, we have 7 class sessions left! In that time, we need to complete our unit project, take a unit test, and take our final exam. Here's a quick summary:
- Given the snow days, I've extended the project. It's now due Monday by the end of the school day
- We'll take our Unit 4 test Wednesday/Thursday next week
- Our final exam will be on the 24th (A day)/27th (B day)

## Remaining Time
No new content today! You can use any remaining time to get the project completed or to review for the test. We'll do some more dedicated review on Monday/Tuesday next week.
