## Lesson Objectives

Today we'll play with Javascript. We'll use a simple programming activity based on turtles.

To get started, [download the code from here](https://hanumanum.github.io/js-turtle/index_en.html)

We'll work together to write some simple examples. After that, I'll talk you through some starter code I've written to draw a turkey. From there, we'll work independently trying to make some nice seasonal turkey drawings.

I'm excited to see what you come up with!
