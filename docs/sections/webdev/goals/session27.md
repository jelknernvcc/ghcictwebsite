## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
I didn't write a reading quiz today. We'll include this in next class's reading quiz.

Don't forget that the *library* assignment was due by the beginning of class today. I'll grade it soon!

### CSS Cascade Examples

We'll play with some examples that demonstrate how the CSS cascade rules work, and how user stylesheets work.

### Divs, and sizing
We'll play with adding divs to our website, and adjusting div sizes and font sizes using a few different notations:
- percentage
- px
- em
- vw

For some of these, we'll follow examples from [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

## Homework

### Reading
Read the next few pages in the CSS course:
- CSS Text Styling Properties
- Introduction to the Box Model
- Box Model Essentials

The box model will unlock a lot of interesting style options. I'll look forward to playing with these in class next time!
