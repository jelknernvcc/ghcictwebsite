## Lesson Objectives
We'll wrap up our survey data project today. Our goal today is to polish up the work that we've done, write it out to a nice Jupyter Notebook file.

### Project Wrap-Up / Submission Instructions
I hope you'll agree with me that this was a great opportunity to practice with Pandas, to learn some interesting new data science stuff, and to engage in some participatory democracy.

I'll continue to keep in touch with the Arlington folks about this project, and we might circle back to this project if more interesting data or opportunities come up. In the meantime, we'll move on to a new unit on databases.

For now, let's focus on writing up what you've done so far in a nice format that you can share and be proud of. We'll have a little discussion in class on the importance of maintaining a strong portfolio - and I think that this project will make a fantastic addition to your portfolio.

To submit, write up a Jupyter file that:
- Introduces the Arlington 2050 project, and the specific data subset you worked with. Give as much context as you can about the dataset, and how/where it was collected
- Shows and describes the steps that you took to ingest and clean the data
- Shows and describes any code that does NLP pre-processing
- Includes the work you did to produce word clouds, and describes any observations that you got from your word clouds
- Shows and describes any code that you completed that uses vector embeddings to search and visualize the data, and describes any observations that you got from that exercise
- If the NLP topic or that you researched is not covered in this list, or if you have any other thoughts or observations, feel free to include them!
- Finally, a summary that reflects on this project, what you've learned from it, and what you thought of it. Feel free to discuss whatever you want in this section, you might want to discuss Pandas, Spacy, Arlington, surveys, and/or data science.

My expectation is that this is all code you've already written over the past few weeks (and in many cases code that I provided for you), so this will just be an exercise of pulling your code together and adding some Markdown.

I'd like this to be submitted before class next Thursday, November 14. This represents several weeks of classwork, so I'll weight this Q2 grade a little higher than normal.

We still need to be very careful about not putting data into our repos. Be sure to not commit the data files with your jupyter notebook, and to click the "clear all outputs" button in your notebook before you commit.

### Databases 
I'll also use some class time today to introduce our new SQL unit. In this unit, we'll:
- talk about what SQL is and why it matters
- Discuss the ANSI-SQL standard, and the wide ecosystem of languages that implement the standard
- introduce PostgreSQL, the SQL variant that we'll use for most of this class
- Learn to write SQL queries
- Learn how to combine SQL with all of the other powerful Python tools we've learned so far this year

To get started with SQL, we'll play with [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial), and their [SQL Card Game](https://sqlzoo.net/40289347/)
