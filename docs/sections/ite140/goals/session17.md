## Lesson Objectives
Today we'll work on getting the Arlington 2050 Survey data loaded into Pandas. We'll divide up the datasets and each take one to play with.

Once we get the data loaded, we'll work on making word clouds. Our goal will be to filter the word clouds by source, so that we can tell high-level differences between the groups (eg. will we see more about transportation from people who filled out post cards at the columbia pike library?).

[You can see my sample word cloud code here](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/ITE140/blob/main/word_cloud_sample.ipynb)
