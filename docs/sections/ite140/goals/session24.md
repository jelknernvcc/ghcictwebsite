## What we'll do in class

We'll continue playing with [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) to motivate our exploration of single-table SELECT statements. 

Today we'll add a few new concepts:

- GROUP BY and HAVING
- Subqueries

Then, we'll continue practicing with these concepts using use SQL on Python
Dataframes.

## Data Frames Activity


Last class we setup a Jupyter notebook where we practiced using sqldf to query dataframes.
Today, add a few new examples to that notebook that demonstrate the new concepts that we've learned: aggregate functions, GROUP BY and HAVING, and subqueries.

The goal is that these queries are actually meaningful - we're practicing the syntax here, but we're really exploring practical uses for each of these concepts.

I'll count this as a grade together with the work from last time. We'll present at the beginning of next class.

## Homework, if needed

Continue practicing on your own in SQLZoo! There are lots of good examples for more practice on there.
