## What we'll do in class

### Course Evaluations
<p style="color: red;">
First, please complete your course evaluations. To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.
</p>

### Finish up Data Modelling Project
I'll give the first ~30 minutes of class to wrap up the data modelling project that you've been working on. As you transition into writing the sql scripts and mocking up the data, I'd like each team member to take responsibility for at least one table.

For credit, combine everyone's work into a single sql file and commit it to one of your git repos.

At the beginning of Wednesday's class, we'll present this project. Everyone should explain the table(s) they worked on.

### Introduce your final project

As I hinted last time, your final exam for this class will be a project. [See the full write-up for this project here](https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/db/projects/project.html?id=02final), and I'll go over the requirements in class.


### PostgreSQL Views
Views in SQL will be very useful for our project. We'll discuss them and work through a quick example.

## Homework
- Wrap up your data model activity. Be prepared to present the tables you worked on in class
- Start thinking about your project! We'll have our first check-in next class
