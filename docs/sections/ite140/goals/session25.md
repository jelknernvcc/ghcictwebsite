## What we'll do in class

We'll continue our SQL study, this time playing with queries that span multiple tables.

As before, we'll start our learning [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) 

## SQL Games Activity

After we explore a few JOIN queries in SQLZoo, we'll move on to some games that I think do a great job of making practice fun:
- [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)
- [SQL Island](https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de/)

I'd like you to work through both of these. If you're one of my students who has done this activity before, we'll chat about a good alternative.

## Homework, if needed

Nothing to turn in from today's activity, but you're encouraged to continue practicing on any of the websites we've used so far.
