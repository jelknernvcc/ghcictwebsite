## Lesson Objectives
By the end of today's lesson, you should:
- Be comfortable working with data in Pandas
- Be able to create data visualizations using Seaborn
- Have a professional-looking Jupyter Notebook to share
- Start to understand word2vec, and how we'll use it in NLP

## What we'll do in class
A little bit of a catch-up day today. We will:
- Finish our Pandas data loading activity
- Make some data visualizations with Seaborn
    - Don't forget to `pip install seaborn`
    - The goal should be for your group to publish a Jupyter Notebook that:
        - loads, cleans, and types your dataset
        - calculates some descriptive statistics using Pandas
        - makes and describes a few interesting visualizations
- Chat about the ML tools that we might use for our Arlington 2050 Project

## Homework
No homework for the weekend. We'll start next class by presenting our Pandas notebooks.
