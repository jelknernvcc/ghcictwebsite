<!--
Instructor notes: 
We worked independently today. Folks were at a lot of different places.

at the beginning of class I shared my example project. We specifically discussed how I embedded the Microsoft Word document.

I spent most of the time working with individual students to get their github pages setup. Others worked on their grade calculators.

### What we'll do in class
We'll spend most of today's class continuing on our grade calculators [See the project details here](../projects/project.html?id=01gradecalc).



### Github Pages Setup
By the end of class today, I'd like everyone to have a working Github website, linked to [our student portfolio page](../students.html). I'll spend time today working one-on-one with each of you to make sure this is setup.

## Homework, if needed

Finish your grade calculator - I'll use it for your Week 3 Grade.
