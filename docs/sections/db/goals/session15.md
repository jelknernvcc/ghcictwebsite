## Lesson Objectives


## What we'll do in class
We'll start today's class with presentations about our chosen data science concepts. We'll each present our topics.

After presentations, I'd like everyone to download each other's code. The goal should be for everyone to get everyone's code to run locally.

Starting next class, we'll work through chaining all of these examples together.
