## What we'll do in class
We'll continue to explore JOINs, improve our ability to understand database design, and to answer complicated questions using our SQL knowledge. Last time, we went through this activity together using the tables on [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) 

Today, we'll work through some interesting questions based on senate data on this website: [Select Start SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/questions.html) (and if you're looking for another great reference about basic sql queries, I highly recommend this one!)

I'd like you to work through this exercise in teams. Here are a few warmup questions to get started:
- What is the PK for this table?
- Which senator proposed the most bills? Which state?
- Which bill had the most cosponsors?
    - There are some interesting ones here. Pick a few and google them.

## Homework
Write one new, interesting query using any of the datasets that we've explored today. Start by asking a question, and then figure out how to write the query to answer it. Be prepared to share at the beginning of next class!

The goal here is to practice curiosity and critical thinking about datasets. We want to be able to come up with lots of interesting questions when we're presented with a new dataset!
