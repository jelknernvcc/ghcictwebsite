## What we'll do in class

### Class Charter
I have a draft! I'd love some feedback. [See the draft here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJwfaeJMPwO4wveRAYpc40Xwx0RQHpeF-7e4urK-Ndg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Grade Calculator Project
We'll continue working on our grade calculators [See the project details here](../projects/project.html?id=01gradecalc). 

### Grade Calculator - What If?
In class, we'll play with Excel's What-if analysis tools. We'll briefly look at all 3 of them, but we'll focus on the goal finder and scenarios.

You're welcome to work on your own grade calculator for this part, or you can follow along with the sample that I uploaded to the project page.

## Homework, if needed

Finish your grade calculator - I'll use it for your Week 3 Grade.

If you need more practice with the functions we learned today, you can follow [the nice tutorial here:](https://www.goskills.com/Excel/Resources/What-if-analysis-Excel).
