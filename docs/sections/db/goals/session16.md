## Lesson Objectives
Today we'll meet with [Kristen Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristeneliseclark/), the leader of the Arlington 2050 project. 

This will be an open-ended sharing activity: Kristen will share more about the project, we'll share the data science topics that we've been working on, and we'll brainstorm together about the qualitative coding part of this project.
