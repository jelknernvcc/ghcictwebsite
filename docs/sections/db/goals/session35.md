## What we'll do in class

### Postgres!

We're all a little rusty coming back from break, so we'll do a little review of 
Postgres, and the idempotent SQL scripts that we were working on last time. 

Then we'll continue our database creation activity that we were working on before break.

As a reminder: We decided these groups in class, and started working on them:

* Blu and Lehiem are working on the reservation database for cosmetology
* Adam and Miguel are working on the reservation database for culinary
* Rachael, Jack, and Alex will work on the forum for clean stoves

Our goal will be for each group to have a complete idempotent sql script that creates all the relevant tables, and inserts some mock data (we'll use [https://www.mockaroo.com/](https://www.mockaroo.com/) for this).

### Introduce End of Course Project
Counting today, we'll have 7 total classes left in the semester. So it's time to
start thinking about our **final exam**, which will be a project that combines
SQL, Pandas, and Excel. I'll briefly introduce the project today so that you can
start thinking about it, and I'll have the full write-up ready next time.

## Homework

Enjoy your break, but feel free to continue working on your database design. We'll finish this, with the goal of handing it over, shortly after we get back.
