## What we'll do in class

We'll continue playing with [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) to motivate our exploration of single-table SELECT statements. Last time we got pretty comfortable with SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. 

Today we'll add a few new keywords:

- GROUP BY and HAVING
- LIMIT
- Functions (Aggregation vs Scalar Functions)

Then, we'll learn how to use SQL on Python Dataframes.


## Data Frames Activity

Use SQLDF to practice writing sql queries. Try to come up with one meaningful query for each of these topics:

- LIKE (string column)
- AND/OR
- BETWEEN
- COUNT
- DISTINCT 

Do this in a Jupyter notebook and commit to your repo. We'll continue adding to this notebook for the next few classes, and I'll count this as a grade when it's completed.


## Homework, if needed

Going forward, I'll expect that you're comfortable with everything we've done in class today. I strongly recommend practicing with these concepts on your own. You might want to go through the [Nobel Prize Winners Practice on SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial), which uses the same concepts on a new table.
