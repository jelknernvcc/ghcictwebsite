<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet twice this week, the last week of CSC 215. We will finish
<i>Chapter 5: Structures and Unions</i> this week.

<h3>Last Day Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
I found a post on stackoverflow titled
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/612328/difference-between-struct-and-typedef-struct-in-c/612476">
Difference between 'struct' and 'typedef struct' in C++?</a> that helps clarify
the discussion we had on this topic last class.
</p><p>
As has become our custom, we will begin class by sharing solutions to the
homework from last class. I'll start by sharing my promised first experiment
with Nate's ctest tool. Then volunteers can share what they did with the other
exercises.
</p><p>
After that we will take a look at the <i>very</i> short, but equally
important <i>Section 5.5: Self-Referencial Structures</i> section on page
155 of our text, which introduces the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)">node</a>
structure. This structure will be at the foundation of our work in
<i>CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</i>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Tuesday, January 23rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin today sharing the three programming examples from pages 138 to
146 in our text (sections 5.1 and 5.2). I'll share a version of the first
one using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a>, which
we should have been using all along. We can then have volunteers share the
other two.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Section 5.3: Arrays of Structures</i> and <i>Section 5.4: Structures
and Functions</i> on pages 146 to 155 in our text. Enter, compile, and run
example programs 4 through 8 presented in these two sections.
</p><p>
Pay particular attention to the discussion of <i>passing structures to
function</i>, and make sure you understand the three different ways presented
in the text.
</p><p>
I'm hoping to talk to Nate more about his testing macros, and to test them out
with him using modified versions of the example programs while the rest of
class works on this assignment.
