<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
With our 2 hour delayed start time, we will have less than an hour together
in class on Wednesday.  That should be just the right amount of time to
check-in on our progress finishing <i>Chapter 4: Strings</i>.
</p><p>
During class you will share the work from the end of the chapter assigned
<a href="week19.html">last week</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
The name of our Spring semester course is <i>Data Structures and Analysis of
Algorithms</i>, and with <i>Chapter 5: Structures and Unions</i> we begin to
explore a new topic directly related to our Spring course. In this chapter
we will learn how to structure our data (using the new keyword,
<code>struct</code>), combining several of primitive data types with which we
are now familiar into more abstract data types.
</p><p>
Before coming to class on Friday, read pages 138 to 146 in our text (sections
5.1 and 5.2), and write, compile, and run the three programming examples in
these sections. I highly enourage you to explore a few extentions of the
programming examples, so that you feel you <q>own them</q>.
</p>
