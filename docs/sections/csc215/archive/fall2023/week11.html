<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we continue with our study of <i>The C Programming Language</i>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, November 9th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today by getting back the chapter 2 quiz and discussing 
correct solutions to each of the 8 questions, and how they relate to each
other.
</p><p>
For questions 2, 3, and 4, we will take a look at
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc215/-/raw/master/CprogrammingLanguage2ndEd/ch2/A_4ways.c">
A_4ways.c</a> and discuss how it hopefully illuminates the best way to think
about data values in C.
</p><p>
After discussing the quiz, we will share solutions to the assigned
exercises from last class, and see a presentation from Nate and Sheel on their
work with the BDS C compiler for the Altair 8800.
</p>

<h2>Monday, November 6th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with a quiz on sections 1 to 8 from <i>Chapter 2: Types,
Operators, and Expressions</i> in <i>The C Programming Language 2nd
Edition</i>.
</p><p>
After the quiz I'll briefly share a little adventure I had with
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc222/-/blob/master/C++/pointerplay/chat_gpts_simple_example.c">ChatGPT</a>, and talk about how you should use this
valuable resource in your study of C.
</p><p>
Finally, we will discuss C's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C">bitwise
operators</a> and divide up exercises 2-6 through 2-9 among the four of you. 
</p><p style="color: red;">
<b>NOTE:</b> The quiz took longer than anticipated, so I let Python
choose the exercises for you. Joseph has exercise 2-6, Edward has
exercise 2-7, Julissa has exercise 2-8, and Cyrus exercise 2-9.
