<time datetime="2023-11-13">Two weeks beginning Monday, November 13, 2023</time>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will combine weeks 12 and 13 (since week 13 is only two days long) into
one three class session plan.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Monday, November 20th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today we will have our quiz on functions using bitwise operators. The quiz will
consist of four questions, one each on the four functions defined in
<a href="resources/bit_tools_c.pdf">bit_tools.c</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Enjoy your time with family and friends! We'll begin working on our Base64
project when we return.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, November 16th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Nate, Sheel, and Jeff will spend the day working with the BDS C compiler.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Do a detailed study of the four programs presented in class. Be sure you know
how to evaluate <i>each of the bitwise operator expressions</i> that
they contain, and understand how each program uses these to achieve its aim.
You will be asked to hand trace a specific call to each of these functions
in your quiz on Monday.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Tuesday, November 14th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today by seeing what Sheel and Nate have to show us from
their investigation of BDS C programming on the Altair 8800.
</p><p>
After that I will share edited versions two of the exercises,
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/jejemplo/csc215/raw/branch/master/TheCprogrammingLanguage/ch2/ex2_6.c">
ex2_6.c</a> and
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/jejemplo/csc215/raw/branch/master/TheCprogrammingLanguage/ch2/ex2_7.c">
ex2_7.c</a> (along with the helper file
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/jejemplo/csc215/raw/branch/master/TheCprogrammingLanguage/ch2/bit_tools.h">
bit_tools.h</a>), that you shared in class last Thursday, and we will discuss
two things related to the changes I made:
</p>
<ol>
<li>How they should set the standard for the kind of documentation I will
expect in future homework exercise presentations of this kind.</li>

<li>How you should study these programs to prepare for the quiz we will have
on them next Monday.</li>
<ol>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Julissa and Cyrus will work together to bring 
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/jejemplo/csc215/raw/branch/master/TheCprogrammingLanguage/ch2/ex2_9.c">
ex2_9.c</a> up to the level of clarity provided in the examples I shared,
and Joseph and Edward will do the same with
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/jejemplo/csc215/raw/branch/master/TheCprogrammingLanguage/ch2/ex2_8.c">
ex2_8.c</a>. Come to class Thursday prepared to present your improved versions.
</p><p>
Sheel and Nate should use this time to catch up with Chapters 1 and 2 from
The C Programming Language, and study the examples presented in class, so
that they will be ready for the quiz on these exercises next Monday.
</p><p style="color: red;">
<b>NOTE:</b> Since four of you will be on the senior field trip Thursday,
one of you from each pair should email me (jde232 at email.vcc.edu) with a
link to your competed program. This assignment will count for 25 percent of
your first evaluation for 2nd quarter (with the quiz being the other 75
percent). To earn an <q>A</q> grade, your documentation should be consistent
with the two examples presented in class, and your worked example should
clearly demonstrate how the algorithm in your program works.
