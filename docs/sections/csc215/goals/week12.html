I am out today. You already know what you need to do. I will be evaluating
your work in your git repo beginning tomorrow afternoon at 1 pm. Make it good!
<p></p>
Ved and Luis have committed to giving us a presentation of the ideas from
<i>Chapter 14: Tricky Techniques</i> at the beginning of class next Tuesday.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin with a discussion of what I saw in your git repos when I
evaluated them in the early morning of November 11th. The standard was
certainly set by
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Jamethiel/csc215">Jamethiel</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/CalebNeal07/csc215">Caleb</a>, with honorable
mentions going to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Marin_McCormack/csc215">Marin</a> and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/turner-h/csc215">Turner</a>.
</p><p>
It is obvious that you can't learn assembly language programming without
writing assembly language programs, and you likewise can't learn to use a
text editor without editing text files! The absence of any <code>.ASM</code>
source files in the repos I evaluated was the main reason for loss of grade.
If you want to earn an <b>A</b> on the evaluation this week, <i>be sure to
include your code!</i>
</p><p>
Other than the summary presentation by Ved and Luis of <i>Chapter 14: Tricky
Techniques</i> at the beginning of class on Friday, all class time and homework
time is for you to use to learn the ideas and techniques presented
<i>Section IV: A Library of User Subroutines</i>. Your git repos should reflect
that you managed your time like the academically mature college sophomores that
you are.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I will evaluate your git repos using our
<a href="../resources/class_git_repo_rubric.html">class git repo rubric</a>
<i style="color:red;">Saturday, November 16th at 1 pm</i>. An <b>A</b>
evaluation this time will require the presence of <code>.ASM</code> source code
that includes the use of the I/O libraries presented in the section to write an
original program.
