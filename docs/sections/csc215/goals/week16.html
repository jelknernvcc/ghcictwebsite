<time datetime="2024-12-09">Two weeks beginning, December 9, 2024</time>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In the two weeks we have until Winter break, we will begin a fairly large
project which can use to transition from BDS C on CP/M to C++ on Unix.
</p><p>
The random pairs Python choose for this project are:
</p><pre>
Caleb and Akshay 
Turner and Trostin
Parker and Luis
Marin and Adonis
Anfal and Johan
Ved and Cody
Issac and Jamethiel
Anar and Jeff
</pre><p>
To motivate what we are going to do, I want you to download, compile and run
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/BIGGEST.C">
BIGGEST.C</a> and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/FIXEDPT.C">
FIXEDPT.C</a>. Then download
<a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/ap01.pdf.lr_7928.pdf">The
Large Integer Case Study in C++</a>. To quote the problem statement on page one
of the case study,
</p><blockquote>
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in computing and programming. In many
programming environments the largest value of an integer variable is much too
small to represent large quantities such as the population of the world, the
U.S. national debt, the number of occurrences of the letter 'e' in Melville’s
Moby Dick.
</blockquote><p>
This is <i>definitely true</i> in our Altair 8800 BSD C environment. As you
can see from running the <code>BIGGEST.C</code> program, the largest signed
integer we can store is <code>32767</code>. That's not even large enough to
hold an APS teacher's yearly salary! ;-)
</p><p>
In this project we will use <i>The Large Integer Case Study in C++</i> as a
guide to implement a <code>bigint</code> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">
struct</a> in BSD C.
</p>

<h2>Week of Monday, December 16th</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<div>
<p>
Nate Levin responded to my email with both detailed suggestions as to how to
port his <a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/ctest">ctest</a> to BSD C, and
a kind offer to help guide the process, so Caleb and Akshay will be working on
that, and Anar has been moved to pair with me.
</p><p>
Reading through your study question responses, it is clear that I have not
made what we are tying to do explicit enough, so I'll attempt to do that
now.
</p><p>
Our goal is to implement an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic">
arbitrary-precision</a> integer in BDS C running on CP/M 2.2.
</p><p>
I gave you the College Board's <i>Large Integer Case Study in C++</i> to use
as a guide, but we will need to make <i>significant</i> adjustments and
adaptations to the approach taken in that document to accomodate our much
more limited computing environment.
</p><p>
In future evaluations, I will be explicitely looking for evidence in what you
write that you understand this technical challenge and can reason effectively
about it.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Task / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Work with your partner to continue reading through the case study document.
As you do, try to understand the approach being developed using C++ on a
32 bit machine to solve the problem of creating an arbitrary-precision
integer, and evaluate how that approach would have to be modified to work on
our 8 bit machines using K&amp;R C.
</p><p>
To help stimulate your thinking and to provide me with evidence that you are
<q>getting it</q>, take this sample interaction with our calculator program
beginning on the bottom of page 2 of the case study:
</p><pre>
Enter value: 5000
--&gt; 5000
Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): *
Enter value: 3
--&gt; 15000
Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): +
Enter value: 17
--&gt; 15017
Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): *
Enter value: 4
--&gt; -5468
Enter operator (+ - * (= to quit)): =
</pre><p>
and modify it so that it shows the limits of integer arithmetic in our 8 bit
CP/M environment.
</p><p>
Continue to take notes as you read through the case study. Strive to
<i>show me</i> by what you write that you are understanding both the problem
we are trying to solve and the technical challenges we face to doing it.

<h2>Thursday, December 12th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
A number of you emailed me about problems with the assignment I gave you
(thanks!).  Parker figured it out first, and even identified the problem. On
page 76 of the <i>BSD C Reference Manual</i> it states:
</p><blockquote>
The following is a section-by-section annotation to the <b>C Reference
Manual</b>. For the sake of brevity, some of the items mentioned above will not
be pointed out again; any references to floats, longs, statics,
initializations, etc., found in the book should be ignored.
</blockquote><p>
On the previous page (75), it states that:
</p><blockquote>
There are no explicitly declarable storage classes. <b>Static</b> and
<b>register</b> variables do not exist; all variables are either external or
automatic, depending on the context in which they are declared.
</blockquote><p>
After recieving Parker's email, I put our friend José Ejemplo to work on this,
and he came up with a work around,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/src/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/DATES.C">
DATES.C</a>. We will talk about this in class today.
</p><p>
Next we will get a copy of
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/BigInt/CALC.C">
CALC.C</a>, which implements a BDS C version of the calculator program from
<i>Appendix A: The Calculator</i> in <i>The Large Integer Case Study in
C++</i>.
</p><p>
Then we will discuss the assignment given last class (when I was out), and
decide on a good path forward.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete each of the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download a copy of
<a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/ap01.pdf.lr_7928.pdf">The
Large Integer Case Study in C++</a>.</li>
<li>Read <i>Introduction</i>, <i>Problem Statement</i> and <i>Description
of the Calculator</i>. Create a sub-directory in your git repo named
<code>BigInt</code>. Add a markdown file with your responses to the
<i>Study Questions</i>.</li>
<li>Download
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/CALC.C">
CALC.C</a>, compile it and run it.</li>
</ol><p style="color: red;">
These tasks are due by Saturday, December 14th at 11:59 pm so that I can look
them over early Sunday morning.
</p>

<h2>Tuesday, December 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
The <code>day_of_year</code> and <code>month_day</code> functions are presented
on page 104 of <i>The C Programming Language</i>. Study these functions until
you understand how they work (i.e. write a small test program to experiment
with them). 
</p><p>
Then complete <i>Exercise 5-6</i> on page 110, which asks you to rewrite these
functions using pointers instead of indexing.
</p><p style="color: red;">
To earn an A on your next evaluation, <i>commits made both during class and
between classes</i> must contain evidence of the effective use of the 3 hours
of time you have allotted to work on this, even if you can't complete it.
This and the previous assignment are both due tomorrow, Wednesday, December
11 at 1 pm so I have time to evaluate them before we meet on Thursday. If
you've been slacking, you need to put in more than 3 hours to make up for
what you didn't do last class!
