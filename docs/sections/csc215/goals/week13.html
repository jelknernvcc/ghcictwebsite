November 18 to 25, 2024</time>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet twice this week and once next week, so we will combine these togeter
into <q>week 13</q>.  With hard work and a bit of good fortune, we can finish
our goal of using our I/O library to write simple interactive programs in
assembly language during this time.
</p><p>
We can then return from Thanksgiving break to start week 15, and move from
assembly language to the higher leven and thus much more <q>human friendly</q>
language C.

git "warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF", is that warning tail backward?</a>,
which may help those of you that are having an issue with getting line feed plus
carriage return in your source files.

<p>
Today, Monday, November 25 is the last class session you will have to
complete your assembly language unit project.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Everyone not on the above list should email me a link to their finished
program by Tuesday, November 26th at 11:59 pm.
</p><p>
I will use our
<a href="../resources/class_git_repo_rubric.html">class git repo rubric</a>
to evaluate your work. If you want an A, your repo should show clear evidence
of <i>continual engagement</i> and <i>incremental development</i> as you work
your way toward completing step 4 above.
</p><p>
In addition to the expected git repo contents listed in the rubric, to earn an
A for this project you must:
</p>
<ol>
<li>email me with a link to your completed assembly language program.</li>
<li>your program must assemble and run.</li>
<li>your program must interact with the user (using the I/O library)
and do something useful.</li>
</ol>
