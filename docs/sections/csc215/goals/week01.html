<h2>Overview</h2>

<q>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</q>

<p>
This week we begin our study of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer systems</a>, where
we will take a look <q>under the hood</q> or if you prefer, <q>behind the
curtain</q> of the increasingly ubiquitous yet ever more mystified computers
that we use every day.
</p><p>
We will do this by taking a deep dive into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture">computer
organization</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer
architechture</a> of an historical computer from 1975, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a>.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
<div>
<p>
You've all fallen asleep and awoke back in time on January 1, 1975. It takes
you several days to adjust to your new reality. There are no cell phones, no
World Wide Web, and the Internet's predecessor,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>, is only known and
used by a handful of scientists and engineers. Outside, dinasaurs roam (<i>just
kidding</i>;-), and your ancient computer science teacher is a 14 year old kid
in high school.
</p><p>
After a few weeks adjusting to your new reality, you decide that if you're
going to be stuck in 1975, you might as well make the best of it. You wonder if
the tech skills and knowledge you bring from the future could be of help to you
all in getting a <q>leg up</q> on the last quarter of the 20th century, and you
decide to work together as a team to find out.
</p><p>
Browsing the magazine shelf at a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Eleven">7-Eleven</a> store
(some things haven't changed since 1975, though it's been a long time since
7-Eleven has had a magazine shelf), the following issue of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Electronics">Popular
Electronics</a> magazine catches your eye:
</p><p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cb/Popular_Electronics_Cover_Jan_1975.jpg" alt="Popular Electronics cover January 1975">
</p><p>
Since you know already this is the beginning of something big, several of find
work doing odd jobs and such to piece together the needed $621 to purchase
one of these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair
8800</a> machines.
</p><p>
Altair in hand, it's time to figure out how to use it.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>
Do each of the following initial tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Create a new git repo named <code>csc215</code>.
</li>

<li>
Using your VCCS email, send me an email at <code>jde232@email.vccs.edu</code>
with a link to the git repo you created in the previous step.
</li>

<li>
Download a copy of the orginal
<a href="http://dunfield.classiccmp.org/altair/d/88opman.pdf"
download="Altair8800operatorsManual.pdf">Altair 8800 Operator's Manual</a>.
We will be using this manual as one of our primary resources for our course.
<b>Note:</b> Thanks to Kevin Cole, we now have an
<a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/">online version of the
manual</a> that you will likely find much easier to use.
</li>

<li>Working in a local clone of your <code>csc215</code> repo, create a
subdirectory named <code>Notes</code>, and begin editing a file named
<code>AltairManualPart1notes.md</code>.</li>

<li>Read the following parts, <i>taking extensive and detailed notes
</i> in your <code>AltairManualPart1notes.md</code> file, and making regular
commits of your work:
  <ol>
    <li>PART 1 INTRODUCTION</li>
    <li>A. LOGIC</li>
    <li>B. ELECTRONIC LOGIC</li>
    <li>C. NUMBER SYSTEMS (see <a href="../topics/binocthex.html">Binary,
    Octal, and Hex</a>)</li>
    <li>D. THE BINARY SYSTEM (see <a href="../topics/binocthex.html">Binary,
    Ocatal, and Hex</a>)</li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We will divide up the 5 sections above amongst ourselves and prepare
presentations to be shared in class on Thursday (August 29th) summarizing
the information in each.
</p><p style="color: red;">
<i>NOTE:</i> I plan to design this culminating year in your computer science
pathway with an even more student-centered, problem/project based approach then
we used last year. That means that much of the responsibility for learning
falls on you to actively engage with the course, and to put in the time and
effort needed for success. I'll be responsible for defining the problems on
which we will focus, <q>framing</q> our study, and on working in consultation
with you to adapt and modify our goals and pacing as we go, but you will need
to take control of your learning process to get the most from your experience
here.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, August 29th</h2>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class with group presentations
<a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/part-1.html">Part 1:
Introduction</a> from the <i>Altair 8800 Operator's Manual</i>. Presentions
are:
</p><ul>
<li><b>Part 1 Introduction</b>: Jametheil, Marin and Cody</li>
<li><b>A. Logic</b>: Anfal, Isaac and Luis</li>
<li><b>B. Electronic Logic</b>: Trostin, Johan and Caleb</li>
<li><b>C. Number Systems</b>: Akshay, Anar and Adonis </li>
<li><b>D. The Binary System</b>: Parker, Turner and Dane</li>
</ul><p>
In order to get our hands on our computer as soon as possible, we will skip
past <i>Part 2: Organization of the Altair 8800</i> and move right into
<a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/part-3.html">Part 3:
Operation of the Altair 8800</a>.
</p><p>
Your homework assignment is to read Part 3 <i>slowly, repeatedly, with a
goal of understanding</i> and to take notes summarizing what you have learned.
</p><p>
In class next Wednesday (September 4th) we will work through examples of
programming the <a href="https://www.s2js.com/altair/">MITS Altair
Simulator</a>. I strongely encourage you to try this out on your own before
coming to class. Doing so will make it so much easier for you to understand
what is going on when we do it together.
