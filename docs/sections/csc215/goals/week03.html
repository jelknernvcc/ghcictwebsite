<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will be introduced to the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/Altair8800SimulatorHEXprogramConverter">MITS
Altair Simulator Program Converter</a> and learn to use it to write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a> programs
for the Altair 8800.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, September 12th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class by watching the first in a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB3mwSROoJ4KLWM8KwK0cD1dhX35wILBj">series
of videos</a> on programming the Altair 8800.
</p><p>
The rest of class time will be spent working with the partner you where
assigned last class on the program described in Tuesday's homework section.
Have a program ready to present when you arrive in class on Monday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Your presentation will be evaluated using the rubric and the two specific
objectives (including using a new instruction) introduced last class.

<h2>Tuesday, September 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll start with a re-presentation by me of the adding two 16-bit integers
program we saw on Friday. I'll talk about the need to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>think backwards about what you want to accomplish with your presentation.
</li>
<li>tailor your presentation to the needs of your audience in order to meet
your desired outcomes.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I linked a <a href="../resources/class_presentation_rubric.html">class
presentation rubric</a> to our course homepage that we can use as a guide.
</p><p>
We will be seeing presentations today by Luis, Anfal, Isaac, Adonis and
Akshay on a program that subtracts two numbers and introduces the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's compliment</a>
representation of negative numbers. We will also see a presentation by
Parker, Cody, Jamethiel, Marin and Turner of a program that multiplies two
numbers.
</p><p>
Before that, however, I will show you how to write machine language programs
for the Altair simulator in Hex and convert them into binary files using the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/Altair8800SimulatorHEXprogramConverter">MITS
Altair Simulator Program Converter</a>. Specifically, I will walk you through
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/Altair8800SimulatorHEXprogramConverter/src/branch/master/programs/add2_16bit_numbers.spc">add2
16bit_numbers.spc</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
The following pairs were randomly choosen for the next iteration of our
machine language programming:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 4vw">
Caleb will pair with Trostin.
Issac will pair with Adonis.
Akshay will pair with Johan.
Turner will pair with Anfal.
Parker will pair with Marin.
Jamethiel will pair with Luis.
Cody will pair with Anar.
Ved will pair with Jeff.
</pre>
<p>
The task is to write a new Altair 8800 machine language program that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>has clearly defined input and output (in other words, it does something
<q>useful</q>).</li>
<li>it introduces a new member of the
<a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/part-4.html">Altair
8800 instruction set</a> that we have not seen before.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We will work on these programs in class on Thursday, but you should read
Part 4 of the manual referenced above so you are ready at the start of
class.
