## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand** the importance of aspect ratio in image display
- **Be Able To** create an image gallery with a variety of CSS styles


## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As promised, we'll start with a reading quiz about image styles.

### Activity - Image Gallery
I personally had a lot of trouble figuring out how to use all of the image style attributes- there are so many and they all have such similar names! I think the best way to learn is by experimenting.

Today you'll play with the CSS styles that we've learned by creating your own image gallery. You should create a single HTML page with lots of images. To help us compare, you should use a single for the entire page. You may use your own image, or find one on [https://search.creativecommons.org/](https://search.creativecommons.org/)

#### HTML Page
Your HTML page should include the same `<img>` tag  a bunch of times, each with its own `class` attribute that you will use for styling. You should also link to an external CSS page.

Under each image, include a `<figcaption>` tag and write a short description of the attribute you used to style the image and the impact it has on the way the image is displayed.

#### CSS
You should include all of your styles in a dedicated css file, and use class selectors to style each image. Here is a list of CSS properties you should play with:

- `width` and `height`
- `max-width`, `min-width`, `max-height`, `min-height`
- `align`, `object-fit`, `object-position`
- `border` and `border-radius`
- `box-shadow`
- `opacity`
- `filter` (try a bunch of these)
- `z-index` 
    - (you'll have to play with the `position` attribute for this to make a difference. We haven't formally introduced this yet, so you might want to check out [this documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp))

#### Submission

As always, commit this page to your repo (don't forget to also add the image and your css to your repo) and link to it from your website. I'll go to your homepage and follow links to find it.

This assignment is due by end of day on Monday.
