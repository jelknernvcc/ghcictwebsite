## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** the differences between radio buttons, check boxes, and dropdowns
- **Be able to** implement a form with a variety of input types

## What We'll Do In Class

### No Quiz
As promised, no reading quiz today!

### More Form Elements
We'll have a short discussion about different types of form inputs and when to
use them.

### Form Practice
For classwork, work on re-creating this Google form on your website: 
[You're Invited to an Ice Cream Party!](https://forms.gle/FT8q7ezqT3UAB2BR7)

For each input in this form, be sure to use the best available input type. You should
also:
- Use a **button**, not an input element for submit
- Include a reset
- Send the results as a POST request to this URL [https://httpbin.org/post](https://httpbin.org/post)

Be sure to commit this to your repo, and add a link from your `projects` page. 

This will count as a classwork grade, due at the end of the school day on Monday, February 10.

## Homework

### Check your grades
One of my students found a mistake in their NOVA grade! Please be sure to check
your NOVA transcript!

### Read the last two pages about HTML forms
The final two pages in edube about forms are called 'Forms - Beyond the Basics'
and 'Building HTML Forms'. Take a look at these two pages and prepare for a
reading quiz next class.

### Start thinking about form styling
We'll play with styling our forms next class. If you're interested, feel free to 
start taking a look at [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp) and practicing on your ice cream party form.
