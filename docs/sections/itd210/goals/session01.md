## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:



## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
We'll start class with a reading quiz that covers the assigned reading about forms.

### ITD110 Wrap-up
Congrats on making it through ITD110. I'll take a few minutes to reflect on how it went!

### Form Practice
We'll make our first template HTML page of the semester! We'll make a very simple
HTML page with a form, and we'll practice with different types of inputs and 
request methods. For each, we'll take a look at how our browser displays the form
and what kinds of HTTP requests it generates.


## Homework

### Check your Semester 1 grade 

Your semester 1 grade should be posted on your NOVA syllabus. It is your responsibility
to login to your MyVCCS account and take a look. Let me know if you have any
questions about it!

### Clean up your website

As we go into the new semester, I'd like everyone to take some time cleaning up 
your website and getting ready for all of the new activities we'll work on this
semester.

I'd like everyone's websites to have a few specific features. 
- Your homepage should be at `index.html`
- Somewhere on that homepage, you should have:
    - a link to the github repo for the webpage
    - a link to a projects page that lists all of your projects
        - You should link all of your classwork assignments from this page. 
        - Going forward, I'll expect that you keep this updated and add links for all of your classwork assignments.
        - You're welcome to subdivide/organize this however you want
        - Don't forget to include your journal - we'll write a few more journal entries this semester!

I'll count this as your first classwork assignment of the semester. Please have this done by Friday.


## No reading assignment
And no quiz next class - we'll keep playing with forms.
