## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- Be prepared for the new semester!
- **Know** the difference  between GET and POST submission methods
- **Understand** that form input types provide browser validation, but do not guarantee accurate information
- **Be able to** create simple HTML forms


## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
We'll start class with a reading quiz that covers the assigned reading about forms.

### ITD110 Wrap-up
Congrats on making it through ITD110. I'll take a few minutes to reflect on how it went!

#### Overall Observation

This was my first time teaching ITD110 (and your first time taking it), so I'm proud of all of us for making it through the semester together. I know that I grew as a teacher, and I hope you grew as students. Thanks to everyone who shared feedback!

#### Learning Outcomes

I feel very confident that we did a good job meeting the requirements of ITD110 and preparing you for success in ITD210 and beyond.

From the final exam, I know that there are a few concepts we need to keep reviewing - we'll be sure to do that!

#### Final Projects

They were great! I'm impressed and you should be proud =) I'm working on a showcase that will let you see the great work everyone else has done.

#### Grade Outcomes

Your final grade should be posted in your NOVA transcript now. I'm happy with the grade distribution! 
- A - 14
- B - 9
- C - 3
- D - 5
- E - 4

#### Course Evaluation Feedback

Thanks to everyone who did the course evaluation! The results were aggregated anonymously, and some themes were shared with me. Here are a few of my top resolutions for this semester:
- Many folks said that they want me to post lessons further into the future. I'll work on that!
- More little practice activities, so that the projects are less overwhelming
- I want to be better at grading classwork quickly

#### More feedback?

My anonymous feedback form is always open! Scan the QR codes around the room, or follow this link: [https://forms.gle/Ah4YK68PrUmtK15B6](https://forms.gle/Ah4YK68PrUmtK15B6)

### Form Practice
We'll make our first template HTML page of the semester! We'll make a very simple
HTML page with a form, and we'll practice with different types of inputs and 
request methods. For each, we'll take a look at how our browser displays the form
and what kinds of HTTP requests it generates.


## Homework

### Check your Semester 1 grade 

Your semester 1 grade should be posted on your NOVA syllabus. It is your responsibility
to login to your MyVCCS account and take a look. Let me know if you have any
questions about it!

### Clean up your website

As we go into the new semester, I'd like everyone to take some time cleaning up 
your website and getting ready for all of the new activities we'll work on this
semester.

I'd like everyone's websites to have a few specific features. 
- Your homepage should be at `index.html`
- Somewhere on that homepage, you should have:
    - a link to the github repo for the webpage
    - a link to a projects page that lists all of your projects
        - You should link all of your classwork assignments from this page. 
        - Going forward, I'll expect that you keep this updated and add links for all of your classwork assignments.
        - You're welcome to subdivide/organize this however you want
        - Don't forget to include your journal - we'll write a few more journal entries this semester!

I'll count this as your first classwork assignment of the semester. Please have this done by Friday.


## No reading assignment
And no quiz next class - we'll keep playing with forms.
