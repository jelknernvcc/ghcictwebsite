## What We'll Do In Class

### Start on Project

I'll have the formal write-up for this project next time. In the meantime, you can start working on the project in groups of two or three.

#### Decide which pages to make
You should meet with your group to come up with:
- A list of the most important pages that you think your website needs
    - I'm expecting two pages per person, and at least one page for each person should contain a form.
- Some unifying styles that you'll create

#### Setup your repo
You can use the same repo someone in your group setup last week, or you can make a new one. You'll want to copy my `init.js` to get started.

#### Start Coding
Divide up to decide who will work on which pages. For this project, let's each stick to our our pages to avoid creating a lot of challenging merge errors. The one shared file will be your styles.css - you'll want to coordinate to intentionally make sure two people aren't editing that file at the same time.

## Homework

Continue working on the project - but we'll have more time in class next time.
