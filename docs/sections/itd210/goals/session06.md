## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


## What We'll Do In Class

## Wrap Up PR Activity
Last class, we made PRs against a shared repo. I'll review
that activity, and [we'll look at the commit graph that we all made together](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/students/network)

## Project Write-up

I'll formally review the project requirements, which are [linked here](../projects/)

After that, I'll let you continue working on your project!


## Homework

### Reading
Next class, we'll start a new unit on Multimedia. I think this will be a fun unit!

To get started, let's re-visit images. I'd like you to read two page:
- ["Images" in the HTML Course](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-html/images)
- ["Image Properties" in the CSS Course](https://edube.org/learn/web-dev-ess-css/image-properties)

As usual, be ready for a reading quiz on these two pages next class!
