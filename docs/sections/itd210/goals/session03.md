## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** how forms are divided into logical sections
- **Be able to** create multiple HTML forms for a real-life project

## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start class with a reading quiz about forms.

### More Form Elements
We'll have a short discussion about `fieldsets` and a few other concepts from our reading.

### Important form CSS
We won't go too deep into CSS for forms in this class, but we'll spend a few minutes
discussing a few important topics:
- CSS Selectors based on input type
- Focus

You can find examples of both of these on [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp)



### Introduce Form Project
Over the next few classes, we'll work on a project that involves designing
forms for a real-world website.

I'll introduce two large projects that our CS department is working on this semester -
the reservation system for **Off The Pike**, and for the **Cosmetology Spa Days**.

Students in my other class have started to design the database behind these two websites,
and this class will be working on the web design. This project will be treated 
as a first draft of that effort - and I expect that we'll come back to this over 
the next few months.

For this project, you'll work with a partner during class time, select one of these
two projects to work on, and create a total of four HTML pages. I'll let you decide whichever four HTML pages you think are the most important.

Across these four pages, you should demonstrate:
- very consistent styling - we want these websites to look nice!
- CSS Grid for layout
- At least 3 different forms, with reasonable input types and formatting

You'll do this work in a **new github repo** that you'll share with your partner.
In class today, we'll work on creating this repo and we'll practice using it to collaborate.


## Homework

### No homework!
Start thinking about your form project, but don't start coding yet.
I'll give more details and will give time to work in class next time.
