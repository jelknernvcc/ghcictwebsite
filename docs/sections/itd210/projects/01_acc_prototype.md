# Design a website for an ACC Program

## Introduction

As we've discussed in class, the CS department here at ACC  is starting two exciting new projects - we'll be working with other programs here at this school who both need real, working websites. My other classes will focus on making the websites functional, and this class will help with the design. For now, we're asking you to prepare some simple prototypes that might help us figure out our final design.

### Project 1: Off The Pike
Off The Pike is a restaurant that is run by students in ACC's culinary program. They open a few days each year for full dinner service. Right now, they take reservations by email - and we've committed to build them a reservation website.

#### Here are some sample flyers from these programs

- [Off the Pike Menu](../resources/off_the_pike_menu.pdf)

### Project 2: Cosmetology
ACC's cosmetology program has "spa days" where anyone from the community can come and get spa services. They do reservations by phone, and we're planning to build them a similar website

#### Here's a sample flyer

## Requirements
You will work in teams to design some pages for a sample website. This project 
will be graded individually - each teammate will be responsible for two pages
on the website.

But together as a team, you must build and share a single, cohesive website. This means that:
- Each page should follow a unifying theme (ie they should have similar layouts, colors, fonts, etc)
- All pages should link to each other

### Shared Repo

Each team will share a single github repo, which should be owned by one team member and hosted via their Github Pages. Everyone else should be collaborators on that repo.

Within that repo, each teammate will be responsible for their own pages. The only file that should be shared is a single `styles.css`, which contains your unifying theme elements.

### Two Pages Per Person

With your team, make a list of pages that you think the website needs. Once you've agreed on the list, each teammate will select two pages to own. 

If you are having trouble coming up with a list of pages, try checking out some real restaurant/spa reservation websites online.

### Notes on Sharing a Git Repo

This will be our first project that requires sharing a git repo. You'll find that (as with everything else in life) sharing takes a bit of extra care and patience. You will need to be good about running `git pull` consistently, before making any commits. If a commit slips in, you might need to run `git merge`.

We've also discussed the role of branch-based development in class, and we practiced by making branches on, and pull requests to, [my students repo](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/students). FOr this project, I expect everyone to make at least one pull request. You can merge your own pull request. I recommend that your team uses this model to share development of the `styles.css` file.

### Other Requirements
- Each person's pages should include at least one form. On your form, you should have reasonable input types and request methods

- Each person should write an entry in their journal which includes a reflection on this activity. Your journal entry should include:
    - A link to the website that you worked on
    - A link to the corresponding repo
    - Screenshots of the two pages that you wrote
    - A short description of your form. Specifically, discuss the input types and the request method that you chose
    - A reflection on the development process - how sharing code with others went, how pulling and merging went, and how branch-based development (with pull requests) went.

- I must be able to find your journal and this entry by following links from 
your personal github repo's homepage. If I can't find your journal, you haven't
turned this project in!

- As always, all HTML and CSS that you submit to this class must be valid and should be as semantic as possible. 
- I do not have any specific requirements about HTML/CSS elements or techniques that you must use - those are all in your toolbox now, so you should select which tools are best for this job!

## Grading Rubric  

This project is graded on a 20-point scale. This rubric does not specifically include my general expectations such as semantic and valid HTML/CSS, or linking to your project from your portfolio. I will take additional points off for these issues.

| **Assessment Criteria**         | **Meets Expectations - 4 points**                                                                                  | **Partially Meets Expectations - 3 points**                                     | **Does Not Meet Expectations - 2 points**                                                          | **Not Present - 0 points**                    |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Page Design Consistency**     | Pages match the team’s unifying theme in layout, colors, and fonts. Consistent styling is applied across all pages. | Pages mostly follow the theme but have minor inconsistencies.                   | Pages are noticeably inconsistent in styling, layout, or fonts.                                   | No effort to match the team’s theme.         |
| **Page Linking & Navigation**   | All pages correctly link to each other, and navigation is clear and functional.                                    | Most pages link correctly, but some links are missing or broken.               | Few pages link to each other; navigation is unclear or difficult to use.                          | No internal linking between pages.           |
| **Form Implementation**         | At least one form is well-structured, uses appropriate input types, and has a reasonable request method.             | Form is present but lacks thoughtful input types or proper request method.      | Form is incomplete, incorrectly implemented, or has poor input type choices.                     | No form included.                            |
| **GitHub Collaboration**        | Student actively contributed to the shared GitHub repo, made at least one pull request, and managed merges well.    | Student contributed but had minor issues with pull requests or merging.         | Student made minimal contributions or had trouble using Git collaboratively.                      | No evidence of GitHub contributions.         |
| **Journal Entry & Reflection**  | Journal entry includes required links, screenshots, form description, and a thoughtful reflection.                  | Journal entry is missing one required element or lacks depth in reflection.     | Journal is missing multiple required elements or lacks meaningful reflection.                     | No journal entry submitted.                  |
