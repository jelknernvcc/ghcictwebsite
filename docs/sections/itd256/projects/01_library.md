## Library as a Database: Final Project


### Project Overview
We've spent a lot of time in class discussing that there are a lot of similarities between the database tools that we're using in this class and the way that libraries function. We've also toured some specific libraries to learn more about who they serve, their space and technology constraints, and how they've organized themselves to meet their needs.

For this project, you'll break into groups and focus on one of the specific libraries we've visited (ACC, Columbia Pike, NOVA, Montessori) to make some specific recommendations.

At the end, we'll invite the librarians to a class discussion.

### Background
We've done a ton of preparation for this project, which I'll summarize here:

- We visited some libraries
- We read selections from *Algorithms To Live By* that talked about libraries
- Check out this interesting reddit thread where librarians discuss strategies for organizing fiction books: https://www.reddit.com/r/librarians/comments/93emx7/public_library_staff_how_do_you_organize_your/
- Read this interesting article about a library that organizes books by size, not subject: https://qz.com/802744/the-legendary-new-york-public-library-shelves-books-in-its-underground-stacks-by-size-not-subject

## Assignment Details
Each group will select a library as their “client” and propose an optimal plan tailored to its needs. Your proposal should address:

### 1. **Overall Organization**
- How should the library organize its shelves?
- Should it follow a traditional system (e.g., Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress) or adapt it?
- Should special categories (e.g., large print, themed displays) be handled differently?

### 2. **Retrieval & Discovery**
- How should users find books? Consider catalogs, browsing systems, and digital tools.
- What happens when many people want the same book?
- Should the library prioritize ease of retrieval or discovery of new books?

### 3. **Return Process**
- Outline an efficient return system from the user back to the shelves.
- Consider collection points, reshelving frequency, and error handling (e.g., misplaced books).
- Are there ever situations where the library might switch strategies (eg if book returns triple during exam season?)

## Deliverables
1. A Markdown report in your github repo. 
    - I expect to see commits to this from everyone, so you'll need to add your teammates as collaborators and work together to handle merging. I can give advice about this!
    - We'll share this report back to the librarians so your report should be structured and explained in a way that is meaningful to them.
        - Recommendations should be grounded in our study of databases, but you should provide non-technical explanations for any technical terms, and  you should focus on the "why".
        -  You may want to use flow charts or diagrams to help explain ideas.
    - In your repo, include a link to the field notes and summarize key takeaways.


2. We'll also invite the librarians to a short in-class discussion/presentation



## Grading Rubric
This project will be graded on a 10-point scale
