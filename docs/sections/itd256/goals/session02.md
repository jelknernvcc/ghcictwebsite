## What We'll Do In Class

### Project Kickoff

For homework last time, you read about how libraries act a lot like databases, and some key issues that they face. Today, we'll introduce a project that relates to this metaphor.

We'll start class with a brief discussion about the reading, then we'll visit two libraries: the library at ACC and at the Montessori Elementary school.

In each of these libraries, we'll take a second to explore on our own, and we'll chat with the librarians about how they approach organization, curation, distribution, and returns. 

I'll formally introduce  the rest of the project next class.
