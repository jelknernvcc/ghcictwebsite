## What We'll Do In Class

### Project Kickoff

For homework last time, you read about how libraries act a lot like databases, and some key issues that they face. Today, we'll introduce a project that relates to this metaphor.

We'll start class with a brief discussion about the reading, then we'll visit two libraries: the library at ACC and at the Montessori Elementary school.

In each of these libraries, we'll take a second to explore on our own, and we'll chat with the librarians about how they approach organization, curation, distribution, and returns. 

I'll formally introduce  the rest of the project next class.


### Library Notes

- Sorting
    - different ways to sort
        - they all scale based on the amount of stuff your sorting
        - when you get to big inputs, choosing the wrong method can be really bad
    - practical applications: socks, 
    - if infor is sorted, we can retrieve it more efficiently
    - library tie-in: sorting books - for returns to reshelve

- Caching
    - retrieving information - especially info you've recently retrieved
    - memory hierarchy
    - algorithms for caching
        - FIFO
        - Least recently accessed
        - random
    - library:
        - most recently returned books might be in a sorting area that isn't open to the public
        - Stacks - info that's rarely access can be put somewhere that's hard to get to


Touring Libraries
- find a book
    + 
- talk to the librarians
    + how they organize their shelves
        - how does discovery fit in?
    + book return process
        - 
    + how they think about adding new books
    + stacks? Do they have off-site storage?
    + how they handle physical constraints of their location
