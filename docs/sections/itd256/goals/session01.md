## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** that query performance can vary wildly depending on the exact
execution process.
- **Understand** that database execution is complex, and that there are a lot of
strategies that database engines use to optimize query performance.


## What We'll Do In Class

### Play Cards
We'll use a deck of cards to represent a database. We'll practice:
- Selects (finding cards in your deck)
- Inserts (adding new cards to your deck)
- Deletes (removing cards from your deck)

I've written a bunch of Postgres queries that we'll go through [here](../resources/card_sorting.sql)

## Homework

Do some reading about how each of these concepts applies to real-life situations.

I've selected some excerpts from the fabulous book "Algorithms to Live By," which is available as a PDF here: https://razifalah.github.io/Programming-books/Books/AlgoToLiveBy.pdf

I'd like you to read these sections:
- Chapter 3 - "Sorting" up to the heading "Sorts and Sports" (Pages 79-96)
- Chapter 4 - "Caching" up to the heading "The Tyranny of Experience (Pages 113-133)

As you're reading, take notes in a Markdown file in your github repo. Your notes don't need to focus on the specifics of any of the algorithms, just the themes about why sorting and caching are important.

Focus on the many examples about libraries - and include specific examples about libraries in your notes. 

You'll see that these concepts are very important in library operations - this is a theme that we'll discuss over the next few classes.
