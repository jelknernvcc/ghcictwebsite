## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** that query performance can vary wildly depending on the exact
execution process.
- **Understand** that database execution is complex, and that there are a lot of
strategies that database engines use to optimize query performance.


## What We'll Do In Class

### Play Cards
We'll use a deck of cards to represent a database. We'll practice:
- Selects (finding cards in your deck)
- Inserts (adding new cards to your deck)
- Deletes (removing cards from your deck)

I've written a bunch of Postgres queries that we'll go through [here](../resources/card_sorting.sql)

## Homework
None! We'll introduce a new activity related to database queries on Thursday
