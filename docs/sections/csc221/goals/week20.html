<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is it, the last week of <i>CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
Programming</i>! We explored <i>a lot</i> this semester, and you are leaving
this course with a better understanding of what computer programs are and what
they can do, and with a solid advanced beginner's level knowledge of the
Python programming language. We'll tack on next Tuesday to this last week. When
you come in at the start of February, you will be in <i>ITP 225: Web Scripting
Language</i>. 
</p><p>
That said, from a practical point of view you won't feel any difference, since
we've fused these two courses together in our study plan, and have already
made the transition from this course, with its introduction to Python to the
next one, in which we will use the large Python web application framework
Django to learn to build web applications.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Welcome to our final class of <i>CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
Programming</i>!
</p><p>
We have accomplished <i>a lot</i> this semester - deepening and developing our
programming skills using Python, getting Python certification, and beginning
to apply our program skills toward
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web application</a>
development.
</p><p>
As we've mentioned several times already, when you arrive in class next
Monday you will be in a different course, <i>ITP 225: Web Scripting
Languages</i>, but from a learning perspective, we will simply pick up where
we left off here.
</p>

<p>
    Today we'll chat about security - we know enough now to be dangerous, 
    so there is some responsibility involved in building the kinds of dynamic web applications
    what we'll build this semester.
</p><p>
    We'll spend a few minutes reviewing <a href="https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/django_views#">
        Dr. Chuck's danger example</a>
        and then we'll play with some of our own examples.

        Specifically, we'll layer in our knowledge of SQL to investigate 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL Injection Attacks</a>
        and our knowledge of JavaScript to investigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">
            Cross-site scripting attacks</a>
        </p>

        <p>Once we understand the theory, we'll try it out by hacking a bank (... a pretend one!)
            <a href="https://demo.testfire.net/index.jsp">Here's our victim</a>
    </p>

    <p>Finally, we'll look at the silly story of <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">
        Little Bobby Tables</a>
    </p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>No homework! Let's all take the long weekend to rest, reset, and prepare for the new semester!</p>

<h2>Friday, January 24th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with a quiz on our Django views homework lectures.
</p><p>
We'll then spend the rest of class getting to know the
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/django_projects">django_projects</a>
repo that you <i>forked</i> last class.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Watch <i>Using Templates in Django</i> (10:05) and
<i>Using the Django Template Language (DTL)</i> (11:00) from the
<a href="https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/django_views">Django View and
Templates</a> lesson.</li>

<li>Prepare a 8 x 11 1/2 sheet of paper (front and back) with notes that you
could use on a possible quiz on these lectures at the beginning of our
next class.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Wednesday, January 22nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with the promised quiz on your homework lectures.
</p><p>
After which we will take a quick look back at where we have been recently:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We did a brief study of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> and learned how to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a> to create and query
database tables.</li>

<li>We learned about
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/">Django
Models</a> and how the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM
</a> enables us to write Python code which controls our application's data
base.</li>

<li>During your last homework assignment, you were introduced to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">
MVC</a> software design pattern and how Django implements this pattern in its
own unique (and somewhat confusing) way.</li>
</ol>
<p>
connecting it with another look at Dr. Chuck's <q>big picture</q> diagram:
</p><p>
<img src="resources/DJ4E_BigPicture.png" alt="DJ4E Big Picture">
</p><p>
in light of our new understanding.
</p><p>
Next we will guide you through forking our
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/django_projects">Django Projects</a>
repo, and we will talk about how we plan to use it and how it will relate to
the <a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/dj4e_samples">DJ4E Samples</a>
repo that you cloned last week (<i>Note</i>: we'll talk about why you
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">cloned</a> last week, but we want
you to
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project.html#_forking_projects">
fork</a> today).
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Watch Dr. Chuck's videos, <i>URL Routing in Django</i> (6:59 min)
and <i>Django Views</i> (6:19 min).</li>
