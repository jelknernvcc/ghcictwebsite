## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand**: ü•° How CSS's Box Model and Grid help position items on the screen.
- **Be Able To**: üë©‚Äçüé® Design and implement your own web interfaces.


## What We'll Do In Class

### Websites

Before we move on from `Book Jeff` (for now). We'll have each group show off how
the design and implementation process are going.


### Reading Quiz

As promised, we'll have a short reading quiz based on the SQL videos you watched
for homework

### Thank you for coming to my TED Talk
I love SQL. I can't resist spending a few minutes babbling to you about why üòª.
I'll try to keep this part short...

### SQL Practice
To work on our basic SQL skills, we'll play with [Select Star
SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/), and awesome online and open source textbook
about SQL.

Once we've got the basics of querying a single table down, we'll switch gears to
querying multiple tables. To motivate this, we'll work through a fun SQL game:
the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)

## Homework

### Keep practicing with SQL!
SQL is deceptively easy, but it takes some dedicated practice to get comfortable with it.

If you didn't already, finish working through the murder mystery.

For the rest of your dedicated time, choose your own adventure:
- Read forward in [Select Star
SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/)
- Try a new game similar to SQL Murder Mystery - [SQL Island](https://sql-island.informatik.uni-kl.de/)
- Work through some tutorials on [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)


## A Look Ahead

We'll be together again on Friday. This class might vary a bit based on who is
in attendance. Our plan is to actually create our own local databases, and then
extend our previous "world's simplest web server" example to serve up our first
dynamic web page that queries data from a server.
