## What We'll Do In Class

### Websites
I took a peek your HTML sites. Nice work! We'll continue working on them today. I've also submitted a request to get Codeberg Pages unblocked.

### Reading Quiz
As promised, we'll start with a "reading" quiz based on the assigned videos from 
[https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/css](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/css).

### Discussion - HTML vs CSS
I know the videos were a lot. The reading quiz is very high-level, and we'll go over some of the finer details together.

### Add styles to your website
The videos spent a lot of time talking about the importance of:
- writing valid HTML
- keeping the content of the web page separate from the formatting

Our goal for today will be to add some simple colors and styles to our webpages.

### Colors
As we're adding colors to our websites, we'll have a little discussion about the different ways to specify colors

## Homework
### Finish your HTML page
If you didn't get this finished in class, make sure that you get your HTML page
completed, and use git to publish it to your `pages` repo.

### SQL Reading
Go through the videos on [https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_basic_sql](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_basic_sql). We'll start next class with a reading quiz about SQL.
