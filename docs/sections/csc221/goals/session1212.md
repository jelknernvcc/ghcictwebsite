## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Be Able To**: 👩‍🎨 Design and implement your own web interfaces.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Websites
We'll start by sharing the HTML/CSS pages that we've been working on.

### **NO** Reading Quiz
Last class, I asked everyone to watch Dr. Chuck's SQL videos. We decided to spend a little longer practicing with HTML and CSS. 

But hang on to that SQL knowledge - we'll come back to it soon =)

### HTML Project
Jeff has an idea for a useful website: `Book Jeff`. We'll hear Jeff's pitch, and then we'll work through the design process for that website.

We'll break into three groups (see group assignment below). Each group should:
- Design what this website will look like. It obviously won't be functional yet, but you can pretend you're working on a screenshot of the working application. You might want to spend some time looking around on the internet for similar websites.
- Start by drawing your idea on a whiteboard or on paper (we find that hand-drawing works better than anything computer-based for this step)
- Once you're happy with your drawing, do your best to create it in HTML/CSS

We'll format this as a competition - each team will work on their own design.
May the best design win!

## Homework
### Keep working on your `Book Jeff` pages
You probably won't finish your pages, but make as much progress as you can with your allotted 90 minutes. We'll share our progress and keep working next class.
