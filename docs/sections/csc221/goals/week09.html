<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is our final week to prepare for the PCEP certification, which you will
be taking next week. Stay focused and on task as you prepare for this most
important evaluation of our first quarter!

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
You know the drill by now, we will take <i>PCEP Practice Test 4</i> during
class today, and then go over it during the 2nd half of class.
</p><p>
We also have to discuss our plans for next week. I have the certification exam
scheduled for next Wednesday, which is a half day.  If any of you anticipate
being out that day, we could plan to schedule the exam for Monday instead.
</p><p>
If you miss the PCEP, which is your first quarter final exam, I would have
to enter an E grade and you would not have time to change that before grades
go in. So let's plan wisely.
