## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand**: 🍰 How the three-layer web model works.
- **Be Able To**: 👩‍🎨 Create your own database using sqlite
- **Be Able To**: 👩‍🎨 Create your own dynamic web application

## What We'll Do In Class

### SQLite

I'll introduce SQLite - the most popular database tool in the world, and it's already installed on your school computer. We'll design a database together on the whiteboard and then we'll recreate it in SQLite.

We'll spend a few minutes practicing with queries for each of the CRUD operations.

### Our first dynamic web app

We'll revisit our [simple web server](https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc221/src/branch/master/DJ4E/Lesson2) that we created at the beginning of December. We'll extend it to add some code that connects to our SQLite database and generates a dynamic webpage.

## Homework
