<h2>Due Date</h2>
<p>
Saturday, April 30th, 2016 at 9 AM.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Nick and Henry got together with me this past Saturday to make final
preparations for your RHCSA Tech Expo Challenge next Saturday.  As
described on the <a href="http://www.apsva.us/Page/29503">webpage</a>, you
should arrive at 8:30 AM and be prepared to start the challenge at 9 AM.
</p><p>
You will be given 2 hours, from 9 AM to 11 AM, to complete an assigned set
of tasks, and you will then be judged on your performance in completing these
tasks.
</p>

<h2>Competency</h2>
<p>
Be able to organize self-study in preparation for Saturday's performance
challenge / evaluation.
</p>

<h2>What to do:</h2>
<p>
I will provide you with an RHCSA study guide that Henry kindly prepared for
you.  It contains a subset of the RHCSA topics. Only the topics on this list
are eligible for inclusion as tasks for next Saturday's Tech Expo challenge.
Not all of them will be, naturally, but as with the real RHCSA you will not
know which ones in advance.
</p><p>
Your task this week is to use this study guide to review as many of the topics
you already know as possible and learn those topics you don't know in
preparation for the Tech Expo.
</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
Your evaluation for this week will be your performance at the <q>little big
show</q> (since the <q>big show</q> will be the RHCSA itself) next Saturday.
Good luck!
