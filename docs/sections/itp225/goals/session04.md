## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Understand** how Django views can include Python code to generate dynamic
HTML responses

## What We'll Do In Class

### Grade Templates
Last class, we practiced connecting to each-others' Django servers. Today, we'll
start the same way, but this time we'll actually assign grades. Your homework 
last time was to write three dynamic Django templates. We'll have a paper 
rubric that you'll use to evaluate your partner's three templates.

### A Calculator

Our dynamic templates are a little boring so far. Instead of just repeating
values back to our users, we'd like to start including additional Python code
to make our templates more useful.

We'll do a simple example together, and then you'll continue on our own.

For this activity, you'll create a new Django view that takes in a user's height
and weight as URL parameters, calculates their BMI, and then renders it in a
template. You should also use Django template logic to tell the user which of
the five BMI categories they fall into 
[See this link for the formulae](https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/food-and-nutrition/healthy-eating-and-weight-management/body-mass-index-bmi/)

## Homework

### Make another calculator!

Repeat the BMI steps to create your own calculator. Choose any simple formula
from any math or science class and implement it in Django.

We'll do a similar exercise next class where we'll grade each-others'
calculators.

### Review your notes about template inheritance
We actually assigned the video Django Template Inheritance (6:06) a while ago. 
We're going to play with this topic next time, so please review the video and/or
your notes before next class!
