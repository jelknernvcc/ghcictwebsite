## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

* **understand** how to use Jinja template features
* **be able to** create simple calculators that combine Python and Jinja code.


## What We'll Do In Class

### Grade the template homework

You know how some teachers make students trade papers to grade each-other's homework? We're going to do the same thing, but virtually!

For this activity, you'll start up your server and then exchange IP addresses with a partner. You and your partner will both point your browser to each-other's websites, and we'll provide a rubric that you'll use to give them a grade.

### Pass variables to templates
You'll take our templates a bit further this time - we'll make our templates valid HTML and add some GET parameters.

We'll work through two methods for incorporating GET parameters into your templates - using the request's get() function, and using URL patterns.

### Build Django Calculators
Today in class, you'll use your knowledge of Python and Django to build a fully-functional BMI calculator.

For this activity, you'll create a new Django view that takes in a user's height and weight as URL parameters, calculates their BMI, and then renders it in a template. You should also use Django template logic to tell the user which of the five BMI categories they fall into [See this link for the formulae](https://www.nhsinform.scot/healthy-living/food-and-nutrition/healthy-eating-and-weight-management/body-mass-index-bmi/)

## Homework
Make another calculator!

Repeat the BMI steps to create your own calculator. Choose any simple formula from any math or science class and implement it in Django.

We'll do a similar exercise next class where we'll grade each-others' calculators.
