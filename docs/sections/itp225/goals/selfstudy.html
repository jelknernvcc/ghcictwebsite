<h1>Self-Guided Study Process</h1>

<h2>Goal:</h2>
<p>
The major goal in this process is to help you <em>learn to learn</em> while
allowing you to organize and direct your learning process. Once you become
comfortable with this process, you will be well prepared to perform self
directed investigation and study in the future, and to document your results.
</p>

<h2>Weekly Product</h2>
<p>
You will create a new web page each week to hold your journal for the week.
The journal will contain a new entry for each day, broken down as follows:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Day 1</dt>
  <dd>
  Plan for the week. What do you plan to investigate? What do you plan to
  try out? What do you plan to produce? Take 10 to 20 minutes at the start of
  the week to write down what you plan to accomplish that week.
  </dd>

  <dt>Days 2 to 4</dt>
  <dd>
  Record your progress. Take 10 to 15 minutes each day to write up what you
  did that day.  Look at your plan from Monday to keep your work aligned with 
  your goals.
  </dd>

  <dt>Day 5</dt>
  <dd>
  Reflect on what you did. Take time at the end of class to reflect back on
  what you accomplished this week. Did you meet your goals? Did work proceed as
  you explected? Did unexpected things effect what you had planned to do? What
  did you learn this week? What did you create?
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Since you need to journal 5 times each week, if you are absent for any reason,
<i>you need to make up the class time outside of class</i>.  Your completed
journal should be ready for weekly evaluation each Friday.
</p>

<h2>Evalution</h2>

Your progress will be evaluated each week and you will be given a grade
according to the following rubric:
