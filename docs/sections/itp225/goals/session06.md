## What We'll Do In Class

### 100 Bottles

Jeff will start class by demoing the "100 Bottles ..." page he added to Chris
and his [django_projects](https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/django_projects) repo.

The motivation of this little talk is questions Lary asked last class, so the
focus will be on how he went from an *idea* to a working page, connecting a
``urls.py`` pattern with a ``views.py`` view and rendering a template to create
the HTTP response page.
