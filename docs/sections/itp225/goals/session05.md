## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


- **Understand** How the OOO concept of inheritance can apply to HTML page
generation.
- **Be able to** Use Django template views to minimize HTML repetition and give
your website a consistent look and feel. 

## What We'll Do In Class

### Grade Calculators 
Just like last time, we'll connect to each-others' servers and grade our 
Calculator homeowrk.

### Template Inheritance Discussion

This concept is easy, but implementing it in django takes a lot of steps.
We'll start with a short overview of all of the affected files.

### Update your django_projects to use template inheritance
I've included all of the necessary changes in this Git diff. We'll quickly
discuss the value of a diff - and then you'll work on your own to incorporate
these changes in your repo.

[See my diff here](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/django_projects/commit/0419417462e3e70943ffc50e038c85e098a7dbae)


## Homework

### Update everything to use inheritance
Now that you have inheritance working - go back and update everything we've done so far
to use our `base.html` template file.

### Learn about Generic Views
Watch Dr. Chuck's next video, [about generic views](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/django_generic). Prepare some notes, and be ready for a reading quiz next class!

### Make it your own
Now that all of our HTML and CSS is contained in a single, easy-to-modify file,
you should start to make it your own! You should start modifying the HTML
and CSS to make it your own.
