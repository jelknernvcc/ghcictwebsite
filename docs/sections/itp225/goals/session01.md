<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>
Welcome to
<a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/colleges/nova/courses/ITP225-WebScriptingLanguages">
ITP 225: Web Scripting Languages</a>! Since we began our study of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)">Django web
framework</a> in December, the main thing you will notice about the start of
this new course will be its continuity with the previous one.

<h3>Classwork</h3>

<h4> Make a new repo </h4>
<p>
Now that we're in a new class, we'd like to setup a new repo for our notes and activities. You're welcome to make this repo in whichever git host you prefer. We recommend that you name it <code>ITP225</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once it's created, send a link to both cmj2310@email.vccs.edu and jde232@email.vccs.edu, so that we know where to find it
</p>

<h4>Templates Video</h4>

As always, it's a good idea to take notes on these videos, in your new repo!
