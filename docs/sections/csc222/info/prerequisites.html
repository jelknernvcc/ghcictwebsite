<h2>Context: What You Need to Know When You Get Here</h2>
<p>
The computer science pathway at Arlington Tech has been designed from <q>the
ground up</q> to be an integrated sequence of courses leading to a solid,
rigerous foundation in the field that will prepare students well for both
further study and employment.
</p><p>
While we highly encourage interested students to follow our
<a href="https://apscs.org/index.html?school=acc">full pathway</a> beginning
with DE Web Design, this document is for those students who want to join the
path at other entry points.
</p><p>
Students enrolling in CSC 222 will be expected to have the following skills
on arrival, as we will <i>not</i> be able to dedicate any class time to
aquiring them.

<h3>Managing Your Computer from the Unix CLI</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will work in a Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
environment, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> as our
text editor, and saving (and <q>submitting</q>) our work in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> repositories.
</p><p>
You will need to be <i>comfortable</i>, not just <q>familiar</q> with these
tools to keep up in this class.
</p><p>
Here are several resources to learn what you need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">UNIX Tutorial for
  Beginners</a>. Read
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html">
  Introduction to the UNIX Operating System</a> and complete Tutorials
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html">One</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html">Two</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html">Three</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.mprat.org/Terminus/">Terminus</a> is a
  <i>gamified</i> way to learn / practice Unix CLI skills.</li>

  <li><b>VIM Tutor</b>. At your linux terminal prompt, type:
  <code>vimtutor</code> and hit enter. This loads a script that copies
  a text file to the <code>/tmp</code> and load it into vim. File contains
  a tutorial on using this power, but somewhat difficult to get used to at
  first editor. Use it to learn vim.</li> 

  <li><a href="https://vimschool.netlify.app/">Vim School</a> is a website
  designed to help you learn Vim.</li>

  <li><a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">Vim Adventures</a> helps you
  learn Vim keybindings by playing a game.</li>

  <li><a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Learn Git Branching</a> is
  an interactive, online tutorial for git.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>HelloCSC</h2>
<p>
Now that you have the tools you need, let's have you create your first C++
program.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use vim to create a text file named <code>HelloCSC.cpp</code> with
  the following contents:
  <pre>
  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
      cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World from C++!" &lt;&lt; endl;

      return 0;
  }</pre>
  </li>

  <li>From the unix command prompt with the current working directory
  containing your <code>HelloCSC.cpp</code> file, run the following command:
  <pre>
  $ g++ HelloCSC.cpp</pre>
  This will create a new file named <code>a.out</code> that contains the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary file</a> that
  runs on your computer.
  </li>

  <li>
  To run it, type:
  <pre>
  $ ./a.out</pre>
  You should see the hello message from your program displayed in the consol
  (terminal) window.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>A More Interesting Example</h2>
<p>
For a more interesting example, take a look at
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch04/ch04s00.html">
Exploring the bitwise operators</a> from one of our early exercise sets.
</p><p>
Compile it, run it, and study its output.
</p>

<h2>Making Vim a Lightweight C++ IDE</h2>
<p>
We can bind function keys in Vim so that we don't need to leave the editor to
compile and run our C++ code.
</p>
<p>Use vim to create a text file named <code>.vimrc</code> in your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a>.
</p><p>
Take a look at
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/app_c.html">Appendix C: A
development environment for unit testing</a> and set up the <code>.vimrc</code>
you see there.
