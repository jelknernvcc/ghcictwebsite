<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I'll begin class by reflecting on the work I saw when I evaluated your git
repos over the weekend. The grades were not as good as usual:
<b>A</b>: 10, <b>B</b>: 2, <b>C</b>: 13, <b>D</b>: 1, <b>E</b>: 5.
</p><p>
I assert that you can only learn to program by programming, so putting in the
time is essential if you want to learn to program. The reason for the high
number of C grades is that you did not have any commits <i>between</i> class
periods. With only two weeks remaining in the semester, you will hopefully fix
that practice during these remaining weeks.
</p><p>
Our hardworking, overachieving friend
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215">José Ejemplo</a> put in 5 hours
working on <code>BigInt</code> this past weekend, and he got the
overloaded <code>+</code> operator to work for positive <code>BigInt</code>s
as well as helping me prepare today's lesson.
</p><p>
I'll take a few minutes to describe how he did it, including taking a
look at his <a href="resources/JoseEjemploBigIntCommits.png">commit history</a>.
I've mentioned in class several times now the quote 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Uncle Bob</a> shares 
in his book <i>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</i> by
UML creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch">Grady Booch</a>
who said,
</p><blockquote>
Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose.
Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp
abstractions and straightforward lines of control.
</blockquote><p>
For those of you who aspire to become highly skilled software engineers,
I encourage you to read over the blog post by Brian Norlander,
<a href="https://medium.com/@bpnorlander/stop-writing-code-comments-28fef5272752">Stop
Writing Code Comments</a>.
</p><p>
We'll then talk briefly about any support you need for your projects, and
let you get back to work on them!
