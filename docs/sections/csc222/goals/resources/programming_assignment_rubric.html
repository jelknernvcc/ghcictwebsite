<h1>CSC 222 Programming Assignment Grading Rubric</h1>

  <th>Grade</th>
  <th>Description</th>

  <th>A</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is present in your git repo that compiles and runs on an APS
  issued student laptop (and hopefully on other
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> compliant systems
  like my GNU/Linux workstation) using
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>.  
  The program delivers what is required. Documentation provided with the
  program is sufficient to guide installation and configuration of any 3rd
  party C++ libraries used, and the documentation is provided with the source
  code using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>
  files. Both source code and documentation are located together in a clearly
  structured, easy to navigate
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> repository, and your
  git commit history shows clear evidence of <i>incremental development</i>
  Finally, if called on in class to present the program, you can describe <i>in
  detail</i> both what the program does and how it works.

  <th>B</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is present that compiles and runs on an APS issued laptop.
  It delivers most of what was promised in the requirements, but might
  fall short of fully meeting requirement goals as required for an A.
  Documention allowing visitors to the projects git repository to download,
  compile and run the program mostly works, but may need a bit of web searching
  to get the program running. The program does most of what the documentation
  says it does. Even if the contents of the git repo would otherwise warrant
  an A, inability to effectively to describe what the program does and how it
  works will result in a loss of grade. The commit history shows evidence that
  work was completed outside of class meeting times.

<tr>
  <th>C</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is present that compiles and runs on an APS issued laptop.
  It delivers at least a part of what was required, but might fall well short
  of meeting program goals as required for an A or B.  Documention is lacking
  or missing. The program shows some evidence of working toward the goal of the
  assignment requirements. When called on to present the program in class,
  there is a clear lack of understanding of what is the program does or how it
  works. The commit history only contains a few commits, so it does not
  show evidence of incremental development.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>D</th>
  <td>
  Some work was completed, but it shows only minimal effort and does not
  provide sufficient evidence of goal attainment or learning mastery.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>E</th>
  <td>
  No evidence of work presented.
  </td>
