<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week it's all about getting ready for the CPE!  Six of you have signed
up to test on Monday.  A few others expressed interest in testing later in
the week.  We'll have another practice test for those needing to practice
more before sitting for the certification.
</p>

<h2>Friday, October 25th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
15 of you have already earned CPE certification, with 16 more to go.
</p><p>
I've added the CPE grade to the grade book in Synergy, so those of you who
have taken it already can see your quarter 1 grades pending a retake.
</p><p>
The CPE exam will be scored using the following scale:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A:</b> 70% or higher</li>
<li><b>B:</b> 65% to 69%</li>
<li><b>C:</b> 60% to 64%</li>
<li><b>D:</b> 55% to 59%</li>
<li><b>E:</b> below 55%</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyone who hasn't taken the test by now will not be able to retake before the
end of the quarter, but I do have the previously promised 14 question CPE
Practice test that you can take to improve your score on the last CPE Practice
test you took. I'll have that available in class today for those who will be
taking the certification exam next week.

<h2>Wednesday, October 23rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
After discussion in class on Monday, I decided that focusing on the OpenEDG
curriculum will be more beneficial for those of you preparing for the CPE
certification than another in class practice test would be, so I won't give
the one I was planning to give.
</p><p>
Instead, those of you not taking the CPE today should continue with serious,
focused preparation for it.
</p><p>
For those of you who have earned your CPE certification, I have a programming
assignment for you.
</p>
<blockquote>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of integers on the
command line, with each integer seperated by a space. Your program should
then print out the numbers entered forwards and backwards.
</blockquote>
<p>
Here is a sample run of the program:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 3vw;">
Enter a sequence of numbers, separated by spaces and terminated with Enter:
1 11 42 8 2 29 12 7

Your numbers were:
1 11 42 8 2 29 12 7

Your numbers backwards are:
7 12 29 2 8 42 11 1
</pre>
<p>
I'll want all of you working on this assignment to sit at one of the three
tables in the front of the room. That means Alex H, Eleanor, Brendan, Jake
and Toby in period 1B and Jack, Gabe C, Alex E and Brayden in 4B.
