<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We have now learned all of the C++ that we need for the CPE certification, and
we have results from the test you took last week that was aligned with it.
After a brief look at
<a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/">vectors</a>, we will
spend the next two weeks preparing for and then taking the
<a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpe">C++ Certified Entry-Level Programmer
Certification</a> (CPE) exam.
</p>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin today with a brief demo of
<a href="https://github.com/j-sokol/ncursesPac">ncursesPac</a> followed with
a discussion of our plan getting everyone across the CPE finish line and then
moving beyond.
</p><p>
The rest of class and homework time you will continue working your way through
the <a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpp-essentials-1">C++ Essentials 1</a>
course.
</p><p>
I'll be looking for more volunteers to take the CPE certification.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will start class today with a brief overview of the ideas from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch10.html">Chapter 10:
Vectors</a> that you will need for the CPE.
</p><p>
After that you will get back the tests you took last week, and we will go
over any questions you have (only 1 person got question 4 right, so you should
all have questions!) on the test. The grade distribution was A: 12, B: 4, C: 6,
D: 0, E: 7.  22 of the 29 of you who took the test scored either at the 70%
threshold needed to earn CPE certification or within one or two questions
of meeting that threshold.
</p><p>
I have not yet been issued the CPE vouchers, but I believe that we will have
them soon, at which time students who are ready can begin testing.
</p><p>
You should use any remaining class time to begin working your way through
the <a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpp-essentials-1">C++ Essentials 1</a>
online course. This course is created by the same organization that makes the
<a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpe">CPE exam</a>, and you will have 15 days
to use it to prepare for the certification exam on Thursday, October 31st.
