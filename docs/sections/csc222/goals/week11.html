<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to 2nd Quarter! With the CPE now behind us, it's time for the promised
<i>flip</i> in how we conduct class. Tests and quizzes are out, programs and
presentations are in! We are moving from learning to <i>read</i> C++ programs
to learning to <i>write</i> them.
</p><p>
Of the 31 students in our two sections of this class, 18 have now earned CPE
certification, while 13 have not. Experience has taught me that it is <i>very
difficult</i>, to write in a language you can't effectively read, and I will
explain in class this week how I hope to mitigate this challenge to provide
extra support for students still struggling to learn to effectively read C++.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
After briefly discussing the results of our CPE testing and how I plan to
use the results to plan your learning journey during 2nd quarter, we will
dive right in to <i>writing</i> C++ programs.
</p><p>
Writing C++ programs effectively will require you to have the skills that
enable you to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>manage and edit files from the unix command line.</i>
<li>use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> to submit and
share your work.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Today in class I will present a program I worked on over the break to choose
random pairs of students for programming assignments. I'll use this
opportunity to talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">
iterative and incremental development</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>.
</p><p>
For my first iteration I knew the program would have to support choosing
between the two sections we have of this course: periods 1B and 4B. I decided
I wanted to store class lists for each section in a text file, and to be able
to read in two groups of students from each section depending on their CPE
status. I decided I wanted to choose the section on the command line, and that
the <code>main</code> function should test for correct input and that the
needed file exists befor calling other functions to do the processing of
student pairs.  Here is my first iteration of <code>main</code>, which tests
for correct cli input:
</p><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Too few arguments: enter 1B or 4B for 2nd argument." &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 1;
    }
    if (strcmp(argv[1], "1B") &amp;&amp; strcmp(argv[1], "4B")) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Second argument must be either 1B or 4B,";
        cerr &lt;&lt; " not " &lt;&lt; argv[1] &lt;&lt; '.' &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 2;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; "You made it!" &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
</pre><p>
Now that the command line input is processed, for my next iteration I'll open
the proper classlist file. Remove the last two lines of the code above and
insert:
</p><pre>
    char filename[16];
    strcpy(filename, "classlist");
    strcat(filename, argv[1]);
    strcat(filename, ".dat");
    ifstream infile(filename);
    if (!infile.is_open()) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "Error openning file " &lt;&lt;  filename &lt;&lt; endl;
        return 3;
    }
    return 0;
</pre><p>
Now it's time to process the input file data into a list of students from
which random pairs can be chosen. I want to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>
approach for this, so I'll start with three files that compile successfully
with a failing test:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/commit/3123b2e10dad74b14c2fc20b9b4b0abc8f357fde/choose_pairs/test_pairs_utils.cpp">
test_pairs_utils.cpp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/commit/3123b2e10dad74b14c2fc20b9b4b0abc8f357fde/choose_pairs/pairs_utils.h">
pairs_utils.h</a></li>

pairs_utils.cpp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
That's as far as we'll get today. You'll have the rest of class and homework
time to finish setting up a working
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/app_c.html">unit testing
development environment</a> and learning how to use it.

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
First make sure you have a working unit testing development environment
as we discussed in class.  Spend your remaining homework time reviewing
the skills you will need this quarter: <i>using the unix cli to manage
files and directories</i>, <i>editing text files with vim</i>, and
<i>using git for revision control</i>.
