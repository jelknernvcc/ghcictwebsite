<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we dive right in to learning C++. This is at least your 2nd
programming language, and for many of you your 3rd or more, so we will keep a
very rigerous pace during first quarter, moving quickly enough to complete 11
chapters and prepare for taking the <a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpe">CPE
- C++ Certified Entry-Level Programmer Certification</a> exam at either the end
of first quarter or early in second quarter.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, September 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin by answering any questions you have
from the exercises assigned in 
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch02.html">Chapter 2:
Variables and types</a>, after which we will have a quiz on that chapter.
</p><p>
Time permitting, we will then discuss
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch03.html">Chapter 3:
Functions</a>.  In this chapter we will be introduced to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic">
floating-point numbers</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming)">
functions</a> in C++.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read 
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch03.html">Chapter 3:
Functions</a> and begin completing the exercises at the end of the chapter.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Okay, grades are in for the first assignment. The results where:
<b>A</b>: 27 and <b>E</b>: 11. If you're in the first group, you're off to a
great start. If you're in the second group, reflect on why and consider
whether you have the time in your life to be part of a rigerous, fast-paced
college course.
</p><p>
Before we dive into chapter 2, I'll briefly reflect on the emails I
received for your first assignment over the weekend, and talk to you about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> repos and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file">binary files</a>.
I'll also talk about the very flexible approach I hope to take toward meeting
your widely varying learning needs, and how some of you may find the online
<a href="https://edube.org/study/cppe1">C++ Essentials 1</a> resource to be
just what you need to learn C++.
</p><p>
During class today we will discuss <b>types</b>, <b>values</b>, and
<b>variables</b>.  By the end of class, you should be familiar with the
following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the process of writing and compiling small C++ programs</li>
<li>how to use the <code>cout</code> output stream to display program values
on the console</li>
<li>what <b>values</b> are in C++</li>
<li>what <b>variables</b> are in C++ and how to declare them</li>
<li>the <b>assignment statement</b> and how to use it to assign values to
variables</li>
<li>the <b>increment</b> and <b>decrement</b> operators and how to use
them</li>
<li><b>integer literals</b> and the ways they can be represented</li>
<li>the <b>decimal</b>, <b>binary</b>, <b>octal</b>, and <b>hexadecimal</b>
number systems</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete both
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch02/ch02s00.html">
Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a> and
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch02/ch02s01.html">
Exercise Set 1: CPE Practice</a> from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch02.html">Chapter 2:
Variables and types</a> in our text.
</p><p id="note">
<b>NOTE:</b> If you know how to use git, I enourage you to commit your work to
your git repo. Since I can not assume familiarity with git at this point, and
since we won't have time to practice with it until after we take the CPE
certification, I can not require you to use it now.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
You will have your first quiz with questions similar to those assigned for
homework in class on Thursday.
