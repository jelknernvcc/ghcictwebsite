<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
As promised, the set TDD exercises in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch13/ch13s00.html">
Chapter 13 Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a> has grown. You will have class
time to begin these exercises, which we will continue at the start of the
new year.
</p><p>
Before that, however, Brayden during 4th period, with me being his poor
substitute during 1st period, will share his
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Fractions/BraydenZee">
Fraction Calculator</a>, using this as an opportunity to introduce both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p style="color: red;">
It's that time again. Please visit
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and use your VCCS email
address as you login and your 7-digit NOVA ID as your password to complete
your course evaluation.
</p><p>
The grade distribution on the last assigment was decidedly mixed, with A: 14,
B: 6, C: 4, and E: 7. We will spend the first part of class discussing
this assignment. I've gathered the most complete and most interesting of the
work I found (with proper attribution, of course!) and added it
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Fractions">here</a>.
</p><p>
One thing that we should discuss clearly suggested by your submissions is
the importance of <i>consistency</i> in code formatting (I'll talk about
<a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP 8</a> here and give another of
my frequent shoutouts to Python ;-)
</p><p>
For the remainder of class time we will begin working our way through
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch13.html">Chapter 13: Objects
of vectors</a>. Since you are accustomed to the fact that I am <q>laying
down the track as our train is moving along it</q> you won't be surprised that
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch13/ch13s00.html">
Chapter 13 Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a> will be growing between
now and Thursday.
