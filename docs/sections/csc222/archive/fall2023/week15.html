<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will dive deeper into operator overloading and get more practice
writing classes in C++.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, December 8th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will have a catch up day for some of you, while others will have very little
work needed to complete today's task, but it will hopefully leave us all on the
same page.
</p><p>
Your task is to download a copy of
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15/test_points.cpp">
test_points.cpp</a>, and create <code>Point.h</code> and <code>Point.cpp</code>
files that will pass all these tests without modification.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due by 11:59 pm on Saturday, December 9th and will not be
accepted late. It will be the first part of your <i>Weeks 16 and 17</i> grade.
</p><p>
I will evaluate your work by running:
</p><pre>
$ g++ test_points.cpp Point.cpp
</pre><p>
and then running the <code>a.out</code> file generated. If it passes all the
tests, you earn an A. If it doesn't, I'll need to dig into your source to
figure out what partial credit you deserve.

<h3>Classwork</h3>

<p>
Once again, José Ejemplo has provided us with
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15">an
example solution</a> to our last homework assignment. Please try it out and
make sure you can make it work during class today.
</p><p>
For an additional example of <code>&lt;&lt;</code> overloading, take a look at
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/overloading-the-output-operator-for-your-own-classes?view=msvc-170">
Overloading the &lt;&lt; Operator for Your Own Classes</a>.

<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch15/ch15s01.html">
Chapter 15 Excercise Set 1</a>.  Be sure to divide your <code>Point</code>
into three files: <code>Point.h</code>, <code>Point.cpp</code>, and
<code>test_point.cpp</code>.

<h2>Monday, December 4th</h2>

<h3>Reflection on Chapter 15 Exercise Set 1 Part 1</h3>
<div>
<p>
Going forward, don't put your <code>main</code> function inside your
<code>MyClass.cpp</code> file. Instead, create a separate file named
<code>test_myclass.cpp</code> and either import <code>doctest.h</code>
(preferred) or instantiate and test your class <q>by hand</q> in your own
<code>main</code> function.
</p><p>
For our last homework assignment, our good friend José Ejemplo has provided
us with

<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15">an
example solution</a> he was kindly willing to share.
