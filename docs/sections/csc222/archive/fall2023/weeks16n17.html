<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Since we only have one day of class (Monday, December 18th) during week 17,
we'll combine weeks 16 and 17 here. We will continue our focus on creating
doctested classes in C++.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Monday, December 18th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Akshay, Trostin, Johan, Caleb, and Turner have agreed to take on the challenge
of porting the <i>Think Java 2e</i> card game code to C++ for our introduction
of inheritance
</p><p>
I will be downloading <code>Duriation.h</code> and <code>Duration.cpp</code>
for Dane, Shangwen, Ved, Jackson, Liam, Anar, Marin, James, Fikir, Jamethiel,
Isaac and Adonis beginning Thursday morning.

<h2>Thursday, December 14th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
At the beginning of last class, several additional students were able to
demonstrate a <code>Points</code> class that passed all my doctests, bringing
this group to include:
Parker, Cody, Johan, Luis, Trostin, Turner, Anfal, Ivan, Akshay, Marin and
Caleb.
</p><p>
As mentioned, you all get an automatic <i>bye week</i> on the next assignment,
as you will automatically receive credit for it. That said, at least one of
you has very wisely told me they feel they need more practice with this, and
as elected to do the <code>Duration</code> assignment.
</p><p>
I am looking for a few volunteers from among the bye group to help with
translating the Java code from the end of chapter 13 through chapter 17 of
<a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java-2e/">Think Java 2e</a> into
C++. Nate Levin from my 3rd year class is taking the lead on this, but he
could use some help. I promise to list the folks who make a significant
contribution to this effort either in the
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/contrib.html">Contributor
List</a> or even possibly as one of the co-authors, if the contribution is
really significant.
</p><p>
I need the card game code from chapters 13 and 14 by the beginning of Winter
break, so that I can use it to finish the inheritance chapter over the break
for us to use in January.
</p><p>
Please let me know today if you are interested in working on this project.

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
As promised last class,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15/test_durations.cpp">
test_durations.cpp</a> has been updated with the complete set of tests you will
need to pass. Given that you will not have any homework over the Winter break,
I've extended the due date for this assignment to next Wednesday.
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: red;" >
This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Wednesday, December 20th.

<h2>Tuesday, December 12th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
The following folks implemented a <code>Point</code> class that passed all the
tests in
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15/test_points.cpp">
test_points.cpp</a>: Cody, Johan, Trostin, Turner, Ivan, and Caleb.
</p><p>
I made a copy of each of your solutions, but I haven't had the chance to look
through them in detail yet.  That said, since it seems you have the process of
writing a class to pass provided tests down, I will have a different
assignment for you this week.
</p><p>
For everyone else, I want to give you more practice, so you will be asked
to create a <code>Duration</code> class that implements part of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> standard.
</p><p>
Specifically, it should pass all the tests in
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/raw/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch15/test_durations.cpp">
test_durations.cpp</a>.
</p><blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> this test file will be updated with more tests between now and
the start of class on Thursday. So you can begin with the current tests
(which will remain), but incorporate the additional tests during Thursday's
classwork and homework.
