<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will spend this week writing and sharing solutions to high school
programming contest problems now that we have enough language features to do
that effectively, with a particular focus on
<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strings-in-cpp/">strings in C++</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Our dear friend <a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222">Jos√© Ejemplo</a>
is a thief, but one who in the best tradition of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood">Robin Hood</a>, takes from
those who have an abundance and gives to those in need. He stole the three
wonderful presentations made last class and put the all together for use by
others.
</p><p>
We'll start class today by discussing how to refine and improve our project
submissions (thus saving poor Mr. Ejemplo much needed time).
After that we will discuss
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch09.html">Chapter 9:
More structures</a> in our text and complete the two exercises at the end of
the chapter.
</p><p>
If time permits, we will see another set of student programming project
presentations.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch10.html">Chapter 10:
Vectors</a> in our text and complete the exercises at the end of the chapter.
Also complete the two exercises at the end of chapter 9.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due by 11:59 pm on Saturday, September 30th to give your
teacher time to look at it on Sunday.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Your grade for this week will be based on the commits in your git repo of the
exercises from chapters 8, 9, and 10.

This is a short chapter, and Akshay and Mr. Curtis set us up so well for it
with the
<a href="https://github.com/AkshayKuchibhatla/Cpp_code/blob/master/programming_problems/lychrel_numbers.cpp">lychrel_numbers.cpp</a>
that they presented in class today.
