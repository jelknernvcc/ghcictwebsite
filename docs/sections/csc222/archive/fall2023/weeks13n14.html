<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet only once during week 13, so we will again combine these next two
weeks into one planning page. During weeks 13 and 14 we will finish with
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch14.html">Chapter 14: Objects
of vectors</a> and begin
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch15.html">Chapter 15: Classes
and invarients</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today you will get back your chapter 14 quiz, I will share
<a href="resources/Chapter14QuizSolutions.pdf">solutions</a>, and we will
go over it in detail during class.
</p><p>
The results indicate that the concern I expressed in class before giving the
quiz is justified. While most of you demonstrated a solid understanding of the
concepts we are learning in class, some of you are <q>falling through the
cracks</q>. Here is the grade distribution for our class:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Grade</th><th>Count</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>A</td><td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>B</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C</td><td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>D</td><td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>E</td><td>6</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Tuesday, November 21st</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I looked over your git repos on Sunday, and found that only about half of
you had completed (or even started) the exercises assigned from Chapter 14.
</p><p>
Since I realized that I did not give you a hard due date for those assignments,
I will fix that problem here and now.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Complete all exercises in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch14/ch14s01.html">
Chapter 14 Exercise Set 1</a> by 12:59 pm this evening.
</p><p>
Prepare for a quiz based on these exercises which will be given at the
beginning of class on Tuesday, November 28th.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Your 2nd grade of quarter 2 will consist 20 percent of your git repo evaluation
for the assigned chapter 14 exercises, and 80 percent of your score on the
Chapter 14 quiz.
</p><p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Since we have not had many quizzes in this class this year, I will
prepare a re-take quiz for those of you who do not perform well on the quiz on
Tuesday, November 28th.  However, <i>students who have not completed their
assigned homework exercises on time as evidenced in their git repos will not be
eligible for a retake.</i>.
