<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week will begin working on our final projects. I have the following
rough descriptions of who is doing what with whom:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trostin and Akshay will be using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer">SDL</a>
render geometric graphics. They are working independently, but I'll be trying
to nudge them to collaborate.
</li><li>
Parker also wants to use SDL. He is proposing implementing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario">Super Mario</a> clone. I
don't know enough about SDL to know whether this is too ambitious a goal (I
strongly suspect that it is), but I am encouraging him to collaborate with
Trostin and Akshay to see what they can do with SDL.
</li><li>
Caleb also will be exploring SDL for his final project, but his focus will
the audio aspects of it. He wants to create some kind of CLI appliation that
will use SDL to handle audio.
</li><li>
Adonis and Dane will be learning to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake">CMake</a>. Their goal will be
to show us simple examples directly from our experience in class this semester
of how to use this powerful tool to manage complex software builds.
</li><li>
Anfal, Ved, Luis and Isaac want to work together on a project involving
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI
programming</a>. Specifically, they will explore
<a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php">SFML</a> and use it to create a
simple game that will help beginning students in our CS program become
comfortable with <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> keybindings.
</li><li>
James is going to explore
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a>, using it to create
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">TUI</a>
based file browser.  I can't begin to tell y'all how happy I was to read that!
</li><li>
Ivan will be creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game.  I will encourage him to see if he
can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> for the
user interface, and hopefully collaborate with James a bit on this.
</li><li>
Liam, Fikir, and Anar will be working on an implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">Battleship</a>. This
is another excellent project idea, since the data model is simple enough for
a class like ours, yet interesting enough to be a fabulous learning
opportunity. Once again, it is the UI that would be the challenge, but I've
talked to James about this already, and he's willing to be the <q>ncurses
guy</q>, and help with the UI for these projects.
</li><li>
Shangwen and Cody (though they don't know it yet ;-) are working together to
further develop the <code>Duration</code> object we began back in
<a href="weeks16n17.html">week 17</a>. This is such an important (and
problematic) area in computation, and one which will both meet the learning
objectives of this team and allow them to make a real contribution to our
class.
</li><li>
Jamethiel and Marin will work on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction">text-based
adventure game</a>. The data involved here is much more complicated then
with games like Battleship, but the UI is super simple. I nice trade-off?
I look forward to seeing what they can come up with.
</li><li>
Turner will work on a program to convert text into video, and perhaps a CLI
tool to upload it to YouTube.
</li><li>
Johan is using SDL to create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)">minesweeper</a>
game.
</li><li>
Jackon will use ncurses to create a simple console game that uses vim
keybindings (hkjl) to move around the screen.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will be <i>strongly</i> encouraging anyone who can (and Ivan and Liam, you
two <i>definitely</i> can) to write doctests <i>before</i> implementing
any code solutions.  That way, you will be learning to design your
Tic-Tac-Toe or Battleship
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> before you build it.

<p>
Get started right away with your project. Software development is
<i>very</i> time consuming, so you want to find out as soon as possible if you
are going to be able to complete the project you want.
