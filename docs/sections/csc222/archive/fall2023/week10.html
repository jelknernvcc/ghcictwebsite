<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is the last week of the 1st quarter, so we need to bring closure to
any outstanding evaluations such as the pointers and arrays projects.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, November 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Questions asked by some of you on Wednesday combined with
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/PiviotOnZero">the
pointers and arrays project submitted by Anfal and Anar</a> gave me the idea
for our next project, which we will begin today.
</p>
</div>


<h3>Project: Have a Little Class!</h3>
<div>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
The learning objectives of this project are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>to gain practice separating C++ objects into their three parts: header
file, source file, and testing program.</li>

<li>to introduce you to the use of
<a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a> for the last of
these parts.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Process</h4>
<ol>
<li>Meet your new partner. This is a paired project, and the psuedorandomly
selected pairs for it are: Shangwen and Caleb, Jamethiel and Ivan, Marin and
Ved, Fiker and Liam, Parker and Isaac, Akshay and Jackson, Luis and Anar, Cody
and Johan, Dane and Anfal, James and Turner, and Trostin and Adonis.</li>

<li>Come up with an idea for an object you could implement in C++. Think of
the objects we've met thus far: <code>Point</code>, <code>Time</code>,
<code>Card</code>, and <code>Fraction</code>, and use them for inspiration if
nothing comes to you at first.  Keep your object simple for this project.</li>

<li>Assuming your object is <code>MyObject</code>, create three files:
<code>MyObject.h</code>, <code>MyObject.cpp</code>, and
<code>test_myobject.cpp</code>.  The first of these will hold your object
definition and member function prototypes, and the second the member function
definitions.</li>

<li>
<p>In the third file, start out with this:</p>
<pre>
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include &lt;doctest.h&gt;
#include "MyObject.h"
using namespace std;

TEST_CASE("Test can create and render MyObject") {
    MyObject myobj();
    CHECK(myobj.to_string() == "This is MyObject");
}
</pre>
<p>Fill in the header and source files so that this first test passes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I leave it open ended where you take it from here. Keeping the learning goals
in mind, add more tests and then more features to your object.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This project is due by the beginning of class on Monday, November 13th and will
constitute your first grade for 2nd quarter.

<h2>Wednesday, November 1st</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class today by looking at three submissions for the
<code>Fraction</code> struct exercise, by
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Fractions/IvanHughes">
Ivan</a>,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Fractions/JamesOConnor">
James</a>, and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Fractions/TurnerHolloway">
Turner</a>.
</p><p>
The rest of class time will be spent going through
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch14.html">Chapter 14: Objects
of vectors</a>, and adding to our <code>Card</code> objects and learning
several new features of C++.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Using your 90 minutes of allotted homework time, see how far you can get in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch14/ch14s01.html">
Chapter 14: Exercise Set 1</a>.
</p><p>
Be sure to commit all your work to your git repo. I'll be looking for a commit
history that shows evidence of the process you use to develop solutions to
these problems.
</p><p>
This assignment is due before the start of class on Friday.

<h2>Monday, October 30th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
I am getting more and more excited about
<a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a>, which is just the
kind of testing tool I was hoping to find for C++, having been spoiled by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest">original doctest</a>
developed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)">Tim
Peters</a> for Python.
</p><p>
Today in class I will show you how to configure your local C/C++ development
environment for easy use of this wonderful resource.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Configuring <code>CPATH</code> for Local Libraries</h3>
<div>
<p>
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Environment-Variables.html">CPATH
</a> is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment
variable</a> that specifies the <b>search path</b> that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor">preprocessor</a> uses
for to look for <code>somelibrary.h</code> in a
<code>#include &lt;somelibrary.h&gt;</code>
<a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">directive</a>.
</p><p>
To set our <code>CPATH</code>, we need to: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>create a directory where C/C++ libraries will be stored.</li>
  <li>set the <code>CPATH</code> environment variable to the path to that
  directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On my GNU/Linux box, I did this by:
</p>
<ol>
<li>running:
<pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/lib/gcc/include
</pre>
</li>
<li>add adding the line:
<pre>
export CPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/gcc/include/
</pre>
to my <code>.bashrc</code> file (<i>Note:</i> You MacOS users will have to
add this to <code>.zshrc</code> instead).
</ol>
<p>
After copying
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doctest/doctest/master/doctest/doctest.h">doctest.h</a> to <code>~/.local/lib/gcc/include</code>, I can now just
add:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;doctest.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
to any program in which I want to use doctest.
</p>

<h3>Shout Outs</h3>
<div>
<p>
I keep telling you all how much I love this class. My rather ambitious plan
to foster a <i>community of learning</i> environment is working out more
spendidly than I could have hoped. We are learning from each other as we
head into uncharted waters.
</p><p>
Today I'll share two projects,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/BlackJack">
BlackJack</a>, by Trostin and Marin, and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/ImageMagic">
ImageMagic</a>, inspired by Luis Garces's <code>flippixels</code> example.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete the five exercises in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch13/ch13s01.html">
Chapter 13 Exercise Set 1</a>.
