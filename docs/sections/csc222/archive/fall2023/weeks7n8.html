<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
During the short week (when we meet only once) and the long week (when we meet
three times), we will begin studying C++'s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">
object oriented programming (OOP)</a> features.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, October 20th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with three pointers and arrays presentations.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Finish the exercises at the end of
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch12.html">Chapter 12:
Member functions</a>. Please use class time to work on this assignment.
The last exercise, which asks you to create your own <code>Fraction</code>
structure, will take a good bit of time to complete.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Be ready to present your solutions to these exercises if called on by our
random student chooser when we arrive in class on Tuesday.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, October 18th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin with presentations from Turner and Fikir, and Akshay and Caleb.
We could have one more presentation if another group is ready.
</p><p>
After that we will discuss concepts from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch12.html">Chapter 12:
Member functions</a>. Your homework assignment will be to summarize this
chapter in your own words in your notes.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch12.html">Chapter 12:
Member functions</a> in our text and take good notes on it in a markdown file 
named <code>MemberFunctionsInCPP.md</code>.
</p><p>
Your notes should include mention of each of the following terms: member
function, invoke, current object, interface, implementation, implicit variable
access, constructors, and header files.
</p>

<h2>Monday, October 16th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
As I mentioned last class, I will not be here today, so you should use class
time to complete your pointers and arrays presentation, so that you are ready
to present it in class on Wednesday.
</p><p>
<i>Note:</i> On Wednesday, Turner and Fikir will present a solution to the
bughunt1 problem presented in class, and Akshay and Caleb will have an
alternative project of trying to install QtCreator on their school Macs and
recommending to us whether or not we can do this.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Finish your arrays and pointers presentation.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, October 12th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we will share the first of our pointers and arrays
presentations. I will share
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc222/-/raw/master/LearningToProgramWithHaiku/Lesson7/reverse_me.cc">
reverse_me.cc</a> and
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc222/-/raw/master/LearningToProgramWithHaiku/Lesson7/bughunt1.cc">
bughunt1.cc</a> and offer the latter as a possible arrays and pointers
presentation.
</p><p>
After that we will watch a video by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Robert C. Martin</a>
that offers the best definition of what
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>
really is that I have seen.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Finalize your topic for your arrays and pointers presentation so that you can
work with your partner on it in class on Monday.
