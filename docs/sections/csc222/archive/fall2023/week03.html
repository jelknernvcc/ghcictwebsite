Today in class we will explore functions that return values and learn about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading">function
overloading</a>.
</p><p>
We'll let our intrepid C++ explorer Jos√© Ejemplo show us the way with his
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/thinkcs/exercises/ch05/overload.cpp">
overload.cpp</a> program.
</p>

<h2>Monday, September 11th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Grades for week 2 have been entered in Synergy.  The class distribution was
<b>A</b> - 12, <b>B</b> - 2, <b>C</b> - 5, and <b>E</b> - 1.  Two of you
emailed me <i>before</i> the assignment was due, which earned you a
<q>ticket</q> to complete the assignment after the due time. Unless I made an
error in deriving the grade, the rest of you will keep what you have. We will
start class today reflecting these results and discussing how they relate to
class expectations.
</p><p>
After that we will talk about the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(computer_programming)">
conditional</a> control structure in C++, comparing and contrasting it with
Python.
</p><p>
We will also discuss C++'s support of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion">recursion</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a new subdirectory named <code>ch04</code> inside your
<code>Exercises</code> directory in your git repo. Complete the exercises at
the end of <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch04.html">Chapter
4: Conditionals and recursion</a> from our text.
</p><p>
You should also clean up your git respositories using
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rm">git rm</a> to remove digital
artifacts that do not belong in them. You should add <code>a.out</code> to
your <code>.gitignore</code> file, for example.
</p><p>
I will file
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues">
issues</a> when I see something that needs addressing. Whenever you see an
issue, you should address it and then mark it as
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/closing-an-issue">
closed</a>.
</p><p>
To earn an A on next week's evaluation, you need to close all open issues.
</p>

<h3>Shout Outs</h3>
<p>
Shout out to Parker for his
<a href="https://github.com/PB22-School/csc222/blob/main/Excercises/ch02/ten_mathematical_expressions.cpp">
ten_mathematical_expressions.cpp</a> which nicely met the requirements of the
assignment.
</p><p>
Shout outs to Liam for 
<a href="https://github.com/Shung1t3/csc222/blob/main/exercises/cho3/uselessresult2.cpp">
uselessresult2.cpp</a> and Cody for
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Cody/csc222/src/branch/main/Exercises/ch03/exercise3-2.cpp">
exercise3-2.cpp</a>, which nicely make use of comments to complete the assigned
task.
</p><p>
Shout outs to
<a href="https://github.com/johan-franco/csc222/blob/main/Exercises/ch02/ten_mathematical_expressions.cpp">
Johan</a> and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/turner-h/csc222/src/branch/main/exercises/ch02/ten_mathematical_expressions.cpp">
Turner</a> for their <code>ten_mathematical_expressions.cpp</code> programs,
which use a more advanced approach to a <q>beginner's task</q>, thus letting
me know what they can already do in C++.
</p><p>
Shout out to Trostin for choosing
<a href="https://github.com/bananajoeo7/csc222/tree/main/ch03">good names</a>
