<h3>Classwork: Final Project Proposal</h3>
<div>
<p>
After today, we have the following 7 class meetings between now and the end of
the course: 1/9, 1/11, 1/16, 1/18, 1/22, 1/24 and 1/26. I would like to use
this time to consolidate and solidify what you have learned about C++
programming this semester, and I like to do this by giving you the opportunity
to choose a final project.
</p></p>
By the end of class today, send me an email (from your VCCS email address to
my VCCS email address) that responds to the following prompts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Upon reflection, I have learned in our Object-Oriented Programming this
past semester ...
</li><li>
Upon further reflection, I feel I have struggled with or failed to effectively
learn ...
</li><li>
With what I have learned and what I think I still need to learn, I would like
for my final project to ...
</li><li>
My specific learning objectives for this project include ...
</li><li>
My <i>deliverables</i> upon completion of this project include ...
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>
<div>
<p>
This is a graded assignment <i style="color: red;">due at the end of class</i>.
An <q>A</q> grade will be earned for a complete, thoughtful response. An
email basically stating IDK will earn a <q>D</q> (you can earn a D simply by
sending the email).  <q>B</q> and <q>C</q> grades will occupy the spectrum
between these two.
</p><p>
I will read your emails over the weekend and have a plan ready based on them
when we meet next Tuesday.

<h3>Homework: Piles of WarCards</h3>
<div>
<p>
While I am only half way finished the explanatory text at the end
of <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch14.html">Chapter 14</a>,
I have completed working code (using proper
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> to
develop it) to implement the card game War and made it available
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/Cards">here</a>.
</p><p>
Your homework assignment is to copy these files to your own git repo and to 
confirm that you can compile and run the both the <code>war.cpp</code>
program and the tests in <code>test_warcards_and_piles.cpp</code>.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, January 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
As we near the end of our course, we will begin exploring features of C++ with
which I am not yet well familiar. It took me longer than anticipated to finish
the War card game implementation, which I only completed yesterday. I'll be
editing <i>Chapter 14: Objects of vectors</i> today, to add this new material.
</p><p>
So, if you have not yet completed the <code>Duriation.h</code> and
<code>Duration.cpp</code> assignment given you before the break, you have one
more class period to do so.
