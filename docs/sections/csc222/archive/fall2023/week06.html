<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we move from higher to lower level abstractions in our use of
the C++ programming language by introducing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)">pointers
</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_(data_structure)">arrays</a>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<div>
<p>
Your evaluation for week 6 will be determined by your pointers and arrays
presentation.
</p>

<h2>Friday, October 6th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class with the high school contest presentations from the pairs
that have not yet shared with us: Parker and Dane, Shangwen and Turner, Cody
and Ved, and Ivan and Adonis.
</p><p>
We'll then take a look at
<a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222/blob/main/pointerNarrays/mixed_fruits.cpp">
this</a> crazy little program José Ejemplo wrote as he was trying to wrap his
head around pointers.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Using José's experiment for inspiration, and our class discussion for guidance,
see what you and your new partner can do to learn more about how pointers are
handled in C++.

<h2>Wednesday, October 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will start class today with two or three more programming contest
problem solutions from our classmates.
</p><p>
After that things will get really messy, since we will dive head first into an
exploration of <b>garbage</b>. Our fearless explorer, José Ejemplo, will lead
the way by sharing his
<a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222/blob/main/stringsNthings/print_garbage.cpp">
print_garbage.cpp</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222/blob/main/stringsNthings/print_garbage.cpp">
print_garbage2.cpp</a> programs. 
</p><p>
After we clean ourselves up, we will select new pairs to work together on a
project to demonstrate how pointers, arrays, and structs can be combined into
useful programs in C++.  An <q>A</q> project will be one which solves some
useful programming problem (<i>any</i> useful programming problem) utilizing
<b>pointers</b> and one or more <b>arrays</b>.
</p><p>
As is only appropriate, we will let C++ choose our pairs, using
<a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222/tree/main/choose_pairs">a little
program</a> José Ejemplo wrote for us just for that purpose (*Note*: pairs
choosen were Cody and Ved, Luis and Shangwen, Marin and Trostin, Jamethiel and
James, Fiker and Turner, Caleb and Akshay, Adonis and Ivan, Parker and Jackson,
Liam and Dane, Anfal and Anar, and Isaac and Johan).
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I've added a few more exercises to the end of
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch11.html">Chapter 11</a>
(with more to come). Please complete these exercises and commit your solutions
to your git repo.

<h2>Monday, October 2nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with feedback on last week's evaluation. Last week was a
tough week for grades in this class. The distribution of grades for week 6 is
A:7, B:5, C:2, D:1, E:7. Fortunately we started the year so strongly that
the overall grade distribution is still A:15, B:6, C:1. Let's agree to make
week 6 an anomaly, not to be repeated.
</p><p>
Going forward, please do each of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Close all open issues. I noticed that a few of you have issues that have
been open for several weeks. <i>Failure to close open issues will cost you a
letter grade on your next evaluation.</i></li>

<li>Complete assignments <i>by their due date</i>. I spend a lot of time
evaluating your work, and I can only do it effectively when assignments are
completed on time.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Next we will share two or three more contest problems. Dane, Parker, Shengwen,
Ved, Liam, Cody, Johan, Turner, Anfal, Ivan, Anar, James, Fikir and Adonis
still have to present.
</p><p>
After that we will check-in for questions on the chapters assigned last week
(8, 9, and 10).
</p><p>
Finially, as time permits, we will begin our exploration into the wonderful
world of <b>pointers</b> and
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointer_arithmetic.htm">
address arithmetic</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch11.html">Chapter 11:
Pointers and arrays</a> in our text and complete the exercises at the end of
the chapter.
