<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Between now and the end of the semester (Friday, January 26th) you will be
working on your end of course projects. This week I will be meeting with
each of you to see how you are progressing, and discussing adjustments you
may need to make to be sure you have a deliverable ready by the 26th.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>

<p>
Most of you have not completed your <a href="https://nova.mce.cc/">NVCC course
evaluation</a>. <i>Please do so now!</i> Use your VCCS email address as your
login and your 7 digit student ID as your password.
</p><p>
Read over the description of your project that I posted
<a href="week19.html">last week</a>, and be sure to discuss with me any
changes you need to make to that description.
</p><p>
You will be evaluated on your project based on what you said you were going to
do, so it is important that this description be accurate.
