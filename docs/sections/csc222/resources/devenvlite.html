<h2>CSC 201: Computer Science I</h2>
<h1>Java Development Environment Lite</h1>
</div>
</header>
<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">
integrated development environment</a> (IDE) is a computer program that
provides integrated editing, building, and debugging of computer software.
For Java development, two well known IDEs are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(software)">Eclipse</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans">NetBeans</a>, both of which
are powerful and well supported free software applications. Since we will be
using Java in this course, you may want to explore one or both of these
programs, and you are both welcome and encouraged to do so.
</p><p>
The focus in CSC 201 is on programming constructs and algorithms, and our
programs in this course will never be very large. We won't need the powerful
development features included in these large IDEs, and at this early stage in
our learning we would benefit much more from a simplier, lower-level, and
lighter weight set of tools that will take away some of the <q>magic</q> with
which IDEs often appear to work.
</p><p>
What's more, since we will be using Python in our Data Structures and
Algorithms course next semester, we can use this opportunity to learn one set
of tools that will work effectively in both courses.
</p>

<h2>What You Need to Know First</h2>
<p>
We will work in a Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> and
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> as our
text editor. Use the following tutorials to learn what you need:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/">UNIX Tutorial for
  Beginners</a>. Read
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html">
  Introduction to the UNIX Operating System</a> and complete Tutorials
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html">One</a>,
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html">Two</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html">Three</a>.</li>

  <li><b>VIM Tutor</b>. At your linux terminal prompt, type:
  <code>vimtutor</code> and hit enter. This loads a script that copies
  a text file to the <code>/tmp</code> and load it into vim. File contains
  a tutorial on using this power, but somewhat difficult to get used to at
  first editor. Use it to learn vim.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>HelloCSC</h2>
<p>
Now that we have the tools we need, let's create our first Java program.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use vim to create a text file named <code>HelloCSC.java</code> with
  the following contents:
  <pre>
  public class HelloCSC {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, CSC 201, let's learn some Java!");
      }
  }</pre>
  Note that the name of the file is important. Java requires that the
  name of the class, <code>HelloCSC</code> in this case, be the same as the name
  of the file before the <code>.java</code> file extention.
  </li>

  <li>From the unix command prompt with the current working directory
  containing your <code>HelloCSC.java</code> file, run the following command:
  <pre>
  $ javac HelloCSC.java</pre>
  This will create a new file named <code>HelloCSC.class</code> that contains
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java bytecode</a> that
  runs on a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual
  machine</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  To run the bytecode, use:
  <pre>
  $ java HelloCSC</pre>
  and you should see the message inside the
  <code>System.out.println(...)</code> appear on the screen.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>A More Interesting Example</h2>
<p>
Here is another more interesting example, activity 1.3 from your curriculum.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use vim to create a text file named <code>Act1_3.java</code> with
  the following contents:
  <pre>
  public class Act1_3 {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          double a = 3.14159265;
          double b;

          int d = 3;

          b = ((int)(a * Math.pow(10.0, d) + 0.5)) / Math.pow(10.0, d);

          System.out.println(b);
      }
  }</pre>
  </li>

  <li>From the unix command prompt with the current working directory
  containing your <code>Act1_3.java</code> file, run the following command:
  <pre>
  $ javac Act1_3.java</pre>
  This will create a new file named <code>Act1_3.class</code> with 
  Java bytecode.
  </li>
  <li>
  Again, to run the bytecode, use:
  <pre>
  $ java Act1_3</pre>
  This will display the value <code>3.142</code> on the screen, indicating your
  algorithm works correctly.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Making Vim a Lightweight Java IDE</h2>
<p>
We can bind function keys in Vim so that we don't need to leave the editor to
compile and run our Java code.
</p>
<p>Use vim to create a text file named <code>.vimrc</code> in your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory">home directory</a> with
the following contents:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">
" .vimrc
"
" Created by Jeff Elkner and Marco Sirabella 24 September 2016
"
" Turn on systax highlighting and autoindenting
syntax enable
filetype indent on
" set autoindent width to 4 spaces
set et
set sw=4
set smarttab
" Bind &lt;f9&gt; to compile current java source file.
map &lt;f9&gt; :w\|!javac % &lt;cr&gt;
" Bind &lt;f10&gt; to run compiled java file.
map &lt;f10&gt; :w\|!java %:r &lt;cr&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You will now be able to compile your Java source files by pressing the
<code>&lt;F9&gt;</code> key and run them by pressing the
<code>&lt;F10&gt;</code> key.
