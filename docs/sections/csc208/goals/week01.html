<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This course will be a big change from last semester, where we spent our time
learning a new programming language. This semester we will hardly be
programming at all (we'll do a few things to show us how Python can help with
discrete math, but not much), and you will wonder how you ended up on what will
really be another math class, when you thought you had signed-up for computer
science.
</p><p>
Computer science is still a relatively new discipline, and even some of those
most intimately involved with it are not entirely sure what it is (see your
homework assignment). Whatever it is, it is certainly connected with
mathematics, particularly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">discrete
mathematics</a>, which concerns itself with operations on the set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural numbers</a>.
</p><p>
That's what we will be studying this semester, so welcome to <i>CSC 208:
Introduction to Discrete Structures</i>!
</p>

<h2>Thursday, February 6th</h2>
<div>
<p>
Our two hour delay gave me time to read your posts without rushing. It also
means we'll have less than an hour for class, so we need to get right to it.
</p><p>
The grade distribution was <b>A</b> 13, <b>B</b>: 7, <b>C</b>: 4, <b>D</b>: 4,
<b>E</b>: 3.  Shout outs to

</p><p>
The top prize for best repo goes to Abi, and we should take a few minites to
look at both his
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Abi/CSC208/src/branch/main/ch0_preliminaries/latex_experiments1.md">
LaTeX Cheat Sheet</a> and his
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Abi/CSC208/src/branch/main/ch0_preliminaries/Notes/WhatIsComputerScience.md">
Summary of I'm Not a Real Scientist, and That's Okay</a> to talk about why I am
giving him this <q>award</q>.
</p><p>
A few general observations from your work that will be useful going forward:
</p><ul>
<li>Take a few minutes (it should only take <i>a few minutes</i>, that's the
major beauty of Markdown) to learn
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">basic Markdown syntax</a>,
including headings, lists, <b>bold</b> and <i>italics</i> and blockquotes.</li>

<li>Strive to design Markdown files that <i>look like presentations</i>. Abi's
examples are exactly what I mean by this, so take a look at them again.</li>

<li>Be sure to check your embedded LaTeX to be sure it is rendering properly.
It is easy to overlook this when you're in a rush, and you end up with
and unsightly mess when looking at your rendered document.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4/ch_intro.html">
Chapter 0 Introduction and Preliminaries</a> in
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4/dmoi4.html">our text</a>.
In the <code>ch0_preliminaries</code> subdirectory in your git repo, create a
Markdown file named <code>ch0_notes.md</code> and summarize the vocabulary
key concepts introduced in the chapter. The following questions may help
guide you in this:
</p><ul>
<li>What is <b>discrete math</b>?

<li>What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented
in the book?</li>

<li>What are <b>discrete structures</b>? Which specific examples are listed
in the chapter? Briefly describe each of these.</li>
</ul><p>

This assignment is due Sunday, February 9th at 12:00 noon.

<h2>Tuesday, February 4th</h2>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin with a hands-on activity to <i>git</i> us ready for the workflow we
will use to submit work in this class, and end with a homework assignment that
asks us to think about what we will doing in this course.
</p><p>
<i>The classwork is due at the end of the period, so don't waste time gitting
to it! ;-)</i>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new git repo for this class on your favorite git host, and <i>email me
its URL</i>. Name your repo <code>csc208</code>.
</li><li>
Add a <code>.gitignore</code> to your repo to assure that artifacts like
<code>.DS_Store</code> don't end up in your repo. You will lose a letter
grade this semester on repo evaluation assignments if I see such things.
</li><li>
Add a subdirectory to your repo named <code>ch0_preliminaries</code>.
</li><li>
Take a look at each of the following 
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> files, viewing their
source to see how they are written:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/README.md">Chapter 0: Introduction and Preliminaries</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/LogicalStatementsAndProofs.md">
    Logical Statements and Proofs</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/SquareRootOfTwo.md">
    The Square Root of 2 Is Irrational</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/TruthTables.md">
    Truth Tables with Python</a></li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
Add a Markdown file in your <code>ch0_prelimaries</code> directory named
<code>latex_experiments1.md</code>. Find interesting examples of
<a href="https://www.upyesp.org/posts/makrdown-vscode-math-notation/">adding
math notation to Markdown</a> from the list above (or other places, if you're
feeling really ambitious), and use them to add your own <i>remixes</i> to this
document.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read
<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/im-not-a-real-scientist-and-thats-okay/">
I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay</a>. In the  
<code>ch0_preliminaries</code> subdirectory in your git repo, create a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> file named
<code>WhatIsComputerScience.md</code> and write a few paragraphs summarizing
Steve Wartik's post and reflecting on why you were asked to read it.  Look up
John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan and say a bit about who they are and what they
did.
