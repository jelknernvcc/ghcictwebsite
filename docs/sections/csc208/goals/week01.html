<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This course will be a big change from last semester, where we spent our time
learning a new programming language. This semester we will hardly be
programming at all (we'll do a few things to show us how Python can help with
discrete math, but not much), and you will wonder how you ended up on what will
really be another math class, when you thought you had signed-up for computer
science.
</p><p>
Computer science is still a relatively new discipline, and even some of those
most intimately involved with it are not entirely sure what it is (see your
homework assignment). Whatever it is, it is certainly connected with
mathematics, particularly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">discrete
mathematics</a>, which concerns itself with operations on the set of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">natural numbers</a>.
</p><p>
That's what we will be studying this semester, so welcome to <i>CSC 208:
Introduction to Discrete Structures</i>!
</p>

<section>
<h2>Monday, February 3rd</h2>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin with a hands-on activity to <i>git</i> us ready for the workflow we
will use to submit work in this class, and end with a homework assignment that
asks us to think about what we will doing in this course.
</p><p>
<i>The classwork is due at the end of the period, so don't waste time gitting
to it! ;-)</i>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Create a new git repo for this class on your favorite git host, and <i>email me
its URL</i>. Name your repo <code>csc208</code>.
</li><li>
Add a <code>.gitignore</code> to your repo to assure that artifacts like
<code>.DS_Store</code> don't end up in your repo. You will loose a letter
grade this semester on repo evaluation assignments if I see such things.
</li><li>
Add a subdirectory to your repo named <code>ch0_preliminaries</code>.
</li><li>
Take a look at each of the following 
<a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a> files, viewing their
source to see how they are written:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/README.md">Chapter 0: Introduction and Preliminaries</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/LogicalStatementsAndProofs.md">
    Logical Statements and Proofs</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/SquareRootOfTwo.md">
    The Square Root of 2 Is Irrational</a></li>

    <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch0_preliminaries/TruthTables.md">
    Truth Tables with Python</a></li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
Add a Markdown file in your <code>ch0_prelimaries</code> directory named
<code>latex_experiments1.md</code>. Find interesting examples of
<a href="https://www.upyesp.org/posts/makrdown-vscode-math-notation/">adding
math notation to Markdown</a> from the list above (or other places, if you're
feeling really ambitious), and add them to this document.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read
<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/im-not-a-real-scientist-and-thats-okay/">
I'm not a real scientist, and that's okay</a>. Create a subdirectory named
<code>Notes</code> in your git repo. In a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> file named
<code>WhatIsComputerScience.md</code> inside the
<code>ch0_preliminaries</code> subdirectory of your repo, write a few
paragraphs summarizing Steve Wartik's post and reflecting on why you were asked
to read it.  Look up John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan and say a bit about who
they are and what they did.
