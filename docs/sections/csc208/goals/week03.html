<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will complete the next section from our text, <i>Section 1.3:
Rules of Logic</i> to prepare for our first quiz next week.
</p><p style="color: red;">
So sorry students, but I'm sick, and I won't be in on Wednesday. I've some kind
of virus, and I don't know what the trajectory is for it. Wish me a speedy
recovery so I can be there on Friday. In the mean time, I've updated our plans
for this week.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We won't have the tools we need for a proper quiz until we can make a basic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof">proof</a>, so we
will spend this week developing what we need to do that.

Complete
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4/sec_logic-rules.html">Section
1.3: Rules of Logic</a>, reading the section and working the exercises

The plan is to have the first quiz next Tuesday, but that will only happen if
I am in on Friday to go over this with you.
