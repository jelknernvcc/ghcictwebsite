<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div style="color: red;">
<p>
I am out sick today. Synergy was down Sunday, but I just entered your section
1.2 evaluations. Grades were not very good. I will give you both class time
and homework time to complete your study of <b>counting subsets</b>,
<b>bit strings</b>, <b>lattice paths</b>, and <b>binomial coefficients</b>.
</p><p>
<i>This assignment is due at 11:59 pm tonight.</i>
</p><p>
Jamethiel, Cody, Ivan, and Isaac will present their solutions in class on
Thursday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I will average Sunday's evaluation with this one and update your grades
accordingly. Those of you who already have an A (not too many of you) can use
this time to either review or get caught up on work for other classes.
