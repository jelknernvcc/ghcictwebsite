<h1>CSC 208 Class Presentation (Written and Oral) Grading Rubric</h1>

  <th>A</th>
  <td>
  <p>
  The topic presented is clearly and accurately summarized.  There is evident
  understanding of the key idea(s), which are presented in a way that will help
  remember them. The work shows clear evidence of effective use of the time
  allotted for its presentation, with a commit history showing evidence of
  <i>iterative development</i> over this time. When presenting a new topic to
  class, at least two additional resources are utilized (and credited) 
  that reinforce and/or supplement our textbook. An appropriate number of
  solutions to <i>well chosen</i> example exercises from the chapter are
  presented. In group oral presentations, <i>to earn credit, each presenter in
  a group must play an active role in the presentation.</i>
  </p><p>
  All presentations should be created in
  <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown</a> files
  under revision control in your git repository for this class.
