<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will study
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof">mathematical
proofs</a>, completing <i>Section 3.2: Proofs</i> in our text.
</p>

<h2>Friday, April 26th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will get back our <i>Section 3.1: Propositional Logic</i> tests today. The
results for the class were good: A - 12; B - 2; C - 1; D - 6. The most
prevalent misconception revealed by the test was how <i>negation</i> works
with an <i>implication</i>. It was obvious from the tests that intiution
about this is often wrong, providing us with one of the strongest arguments for
studying formal logic and truth tables.
</p><p>
As usual, our friend Jos√© Ejemplo worked overtime to provide us with a nice
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch3_logic/PropositionalLogicTestSolutions.md">solution
guide</a> to the test. We'll take a look at that at the beginning of class, and
then resume our work on <i>Section 3.2: Proofs</i>.

<h2>Wednesday, April 24th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today by looking closely at the proof in our book of
<i>Theorem 3.2.1: There are infinitely many prime numbers</i>.  This is
a wonderful example of a <i>proof by contradiction</i>, referred to in
classical logic as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad
absurdum</a>.
</p><p>
I'll check in with you to confirm you have listed this and the
other proof techniques presented in our text.
</p><p>
Then we will use both the remainder of class and our homework time
to begin working through the exercises at the end of the
section.
