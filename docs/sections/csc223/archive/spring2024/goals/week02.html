<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will finish reading <i>Chapter 2: Introduction to Data Structures
and Algorithms</i>, which will provide us with the broad overview of the rest
of our course.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, February 9th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with the promised <i>short</i> quiz on Big-O concepts.
After that we will start <i>Chapter 6: Linked Lists</i>. Now that we have
<q>found our grove</q>, I would like to turn our study of this chapter
(and with any luck, all the chapters hereafter) into a collaborative problem
solving exercise, using Nate's
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc223/src/branch/master/resources/ctest.h">
ctest.h</a> and following
<a href="https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/">TDD</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Chapter 6: Linked Lists</i> in our textbook from pages 162 through
the end of the narative <i>Section 6.2: Singly Linked Lists</i> on page 175.
Take note in a Markdown file in your git repo. Try to summarize the operations
on linked lists discussed in the subsections in ways you understand, and read
through the pseudocode for understanding of the algorithms.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
Let's discuss in class today how we want to organize this work.

<h2>Monday, February 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with your presentations summarizing the <i>very</i>
important ideas from the second half of <i>Chapter 2: Introduction to Data
Structures and Algorithms</i>.
</p><p>
After that we will talk about the problems from the end of the chapter that
will be assigned for homework and how they will prepare you for the quiz
on Big-O notation that we will have on Friday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete <i>Review Questions</i> 33, 34, and 35.  Look closely at
question 10 in <i>Multiple-choice Questions</i> sections, then watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMUe3zFhM5c">Learn Big O notation in
 6 minutes</a> and make sure you could answer questions like question 10 on
 any of the Big-O times described in the video.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will have a quiz based on this homework assignment on Friday. Your
evaluation for the week will be derived equally from your class presentation
and your quiz score.
