I will be away with our high school programming team at the
<a href="https://egr.vcu.edu/departments/computer/about/high-school-programming-contest/">High
School Programming Contest</a> on Friday, so we need to plan today for both
today and Friday.
</p><p>
Let's pair up to work on program that will do each of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>take a string containing an infix expression with numeric (not variable)
operands as input and construct an expression tree from it.</li>

<li>take an expression tree constructed above as input and evaluate it,
returning its numeric value.</li>

<li>take an expression tree constructed above as input and return strings
containing the expression in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation">Polish notation</a>.
</li>
</ol>
