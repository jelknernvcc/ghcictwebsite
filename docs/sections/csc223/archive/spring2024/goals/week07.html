<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will begin a study of our second
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">ADT</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>.
</p><p>
Stacks are used all over computer science, and are useful in solving a wide
range of problems. After we divide up in to two groups to implement the
stack ADT two different ways, we will study several applications that use
stacks.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p style="color: red;">
I'm out again today. I sent you all an email asking that you please move the
work forward on stack applications without me.  I'm confident you can do that.
I look forward to seeing what you've accomplished on Friday, and to planning
together what we will do next.

<h2>Monday, March 11th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p style="color: red;">
I'm out sick (I've been sick all weekend). Please update the main branch of
<a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/libcsc223">libcsc223</a>. I'll do a
pull as soon as I'm feeling better and look over what you did. Come to
class Wednesday ready to talk about stack applications.
</p><p>
During class today we will share our stack implementations and add them to
our <a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/libcsc223">libcsc223</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Section 7.7: Applications of Stacks</i> on pages 230 to 251 in our
textbook. Take notes on the reading, but skip over the code sections and
instead focus on:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A list of each of the applications presented</li>
<li>A summary of what each application does (what is it for?) and a bit
of reflection on what would be required to implement it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Tuesday so that I have time to read
over it before we meet for class on Wednesday.
