<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will take our stack test and largely finish our work with
queues.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, April 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class by getting back our
<a href="resources/CSC223_Stacks_Quiz.pdf">stack quizzes</a>, and discussing
the solutions. The test on queues will be structured very similarly to this
one, so it is important that you learn from this quiz now even if you did not
score well when you took it.
</p><p>
Then we will share our implementations of the queue ATD and discuss a plan
for what to do next.  There is only one application discussed in
<i>Section 8.5: Applications of Queues</i>, namely, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem">Josephus problem</a>,
whose solution is presented using a circular linked list.  We haven't
implemented that yet. Should we?
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read the first two sections of <i>Chapter 2: Trees</i> from our text on
pages 279 to 286. Take good notes. There is quite a bit of new vocabularly
here, and as I am hoping is becoming clear by now, <i>it is the abstraction
that gives us the power!</i>
</p><p>
You won't see any code here, but you will begin to form the mental scaffolding
of the <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/tree.html">tree</a>
data structure.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Wednesday, April 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll start class today with a short test on stacks. After the test we will
divide up into two groups of three to complete the implementation of the
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/queue.html">queue ADT</a> using
arrays and linked lists.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Use TDD to complete a tested implementation of the queue ADT with the backend
data structure (array or linked list) assigned to your group.
</p><p>
Julissa, Nate, and Joseph will work on the linked list implementation, and
Cyrus, Sheel, and Edward will develop the array implementation. We will share
these on Friday.

<h2>Monday, April 1st</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class with a discussion of the stack test that we will take on
Wednesday.
</p><p>
Then we will divide up into two groups of three to implement the
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/queue.html">queue ADT</a> using
both arrays and linked lists.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Work with your group to implement the queues as we planned in class today.
