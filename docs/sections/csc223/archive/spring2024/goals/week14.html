<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will begin <i>Chapter 10: Efficient Binary Trees</i> in which we
will study
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree">binary search
trees</a> (BSTs),
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threaded_binary_tree">threaded binary
trees</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree">AVL trees</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree">Red-black
trees</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree">splay trees</a>.
</p><p>
Given the number of these topics and the limited time remaining in the year,
I am going to propose a divide and conquer approach to studying them.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
It's that time again, time for <a href=" http://nova.mce.cc/">NVCC course
evaluations</a>!  Please login using your VCCS email address as your
user name and your student ID as your password.
</p><p>
We'll begin class today with groups sharing their solutions to the
Huffman coding problem given <a href="week13.html">last week</a>. After the
presentations, we will discuss our plan for <i>Chapter 10: Efficient Binary
Trees</i>.
</p><p>
We have only 5 weeks left in class, and <i>a lot</i> of important topics yet
to be studied.  I would like to propose the following approach that will
balance the goals of gaining a broad knowledge of the theory with the concrete
skill to implement these data structures in practice.
</p><p>
Let's form pairs, divide up the topics within the chapter (this can be done
because they are mostly independent of each other), implement them, and have
each pair present a summary of the theory along with their implementation of
each topic.
</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<div>
<p>
After discussing in class, here's what we came up with: Joseph and Sheel will
present <i>binary search trees</i> and <i>splay tress</i>. Julissa and Nate
will present <i>Red-Black trees</i> and <i>threaded binary trees</i>, and
Cyrus and Edward present <i>AVL trees</i>. In addition, Jeff will present
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heaps</a>.
</p><p>
The goal is to share these presentations in class on Monday, May 13th.
