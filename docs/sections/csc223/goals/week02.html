<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with your presentations summarizing the <i>very</i>
important ideas from the second half of <i>Chapter 2: Introduction to Data
Structures and Algorithms</i>.
</p><p>
After that we will talk about the problems from the end of the chapter that
will be assigned for homework and how they will prepare you for the quiz
on Big-O notation that we will have on Friday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete <i>Review Questions</i> 33, 34, and 35.  Look closely at
question 10 in <i>Multiple-choice Questions</i> sections, then watch
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMUe3zFhM5c">Learn Big O notation in
 6 minutes</a> and make sure you could answer questions like question 10 on
 any of the Big-O times described in the video.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will have a quiz based on this homework assignment on Friday. Your
evaluation for the week will be derived equally from your class presentation
and your quiz score.
