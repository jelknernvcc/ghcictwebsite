<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223-DataStructuresandAnalysisofAlgorithms/detail">CSC
223: Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</a>! Since we made the jump
from 1975 forward to 2025 about a month ago there will be a lot of continuity
in our study as we move to this new course.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, February 7th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today we will learn how to use
<a href="https://devdocs.io/cpp/language/class_template">class templates</a>
in C++ and discuss how they can be used to implement generic
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/dataStructure.html">data
structures</a> such as the
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/linkedList.html">linked list</a>
that we have been studying.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I asked Python to choose groups, and it gave me back the following:
</p><ul>
  <li>Akshay, Luis, Adonis, and Parker</li>
  <li>Johan, Anfal, Anar and Cody</li>
  <li>Jamethiel, Ved, Trostin and Marin</li>
  <li>Turner, Issac and Caleb</li>
</ul><p>
We will divide up the exercises in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch17/ch17s01.html">
Chapter 17 Exercise Set 1: Templates</a> among these groups.

<h2>Wednesday, February 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
The grade distribution for this first assignment in CSC 223 was
<b>A</b>: 10, <b>C</b>: 1, <b>D</b>: 2, and <b>E</b>: 2. That means that 2/3
of the class was <q>on point</q>, and 1/3, to varying degrees, was not. Not
a terrible result, but I'm convinced we can do better.
</p><p>
We have a short class today, so we will use it to:
</p><ol>
<li>
Properly set up your git repos so that:
  <ul>
      <li>they have a <code>.gitignore</code> file that excludes unwanted
      digital artifacts from creeping into your repo.</li>

      <li>unwanted digital artifacts that already have crept into your
      repos (<code>.vscode</code> subdirectories, <code>.DS_Store</code>
      subdirectories, <code>build</code> subdirectories, etc.) are removed,
      never to return. <span style="color: red;"> <b>Note:</b> after today,
      the presence of such unwanted artifacts will result in a letter grade
      reduction on repo evaluations.</span></li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
Help those of you who do not have your <code>LinkedList</code> files arranged
properly to get them so arranged.
</li><li>
Introduce <a href="https://devdocs.io/cpp/language/class_template">class
templates</a> and finish
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch17.html">Chapter 17: Linked
lists</a>, if time allows.
</li>
</ol><p>
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete the new exercises just added to
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch17/ch17s00.html">
Chapter 17 Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a>.
</p>

<h2>Monday, February 3rd</h2>
<div>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<p>
At the beginning of class you should create a new git repo for this class named
<code>csc223</code> on your favorit git host and email me a link. Please
confirm that the link on the <a href="../students.html">students page</a>
(Jose's already does ;-) from your name works before you leave class today.
</p><p>
We will then have a discussion of the following:
</p>

<h4>First Definitions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Efficient Program</dt>
<dd>
An <b>efficient program</b> is one that executes in the minimum time using
the minimum memory space.
</dd>
<dt>Data Structure</dt>
<dd>
A <b>data structure</b> is a collection of data elements grouped under one
name that are organized and stored so they can be used efficiently.
</dd>
<dt>Abstract Data Type (ADT)</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/abstractDataType.html">abstract
data type</a> (ADT) consists of a set of data values and the associated
operations which can be performed on them precisely specified independent of
any particular implementation.
</dd>
<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> is a finite
sequence of instructions used to solve a class of specific problems or to
perform a computation.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Steps for Choosing a Data Structure</h4>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the problem to determine the operations on the data that must be
supported.</li>
<li>Quantify the resource constraints for each of these operations.</li>
<li>Select the data structure that provides the required operations within
the resource constraints as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The we will then look through
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch17.html">Chapter 17: Linked
lists</a> in our textbook together and discuss the things you should pay
particular attention to as you read through it on your own during your
homework.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>
Use TDD to complete all the test cases in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch17/ch17s00.html">
Chapter 17 Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a>, reading (and <i>rereading</i>
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch17.html">the chapter</a>
as you do, with the aim of truly understanding what you read.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Tuesday, February 4th.
