<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223-DataStructuresandAnalysisofAlgorithms/detail">CSC
223: Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</a>! Since we made the jump
from 1975 forward to 2025 about a month ago there will be a lot of continuity
in our study as we move to this new course.

<h2>Wednesday, February 5th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with our summaries of the reading from our text as planned
last class.
</p><p>
We have already discussed <b>ADT</b>s (section 2.4) and <b>algorithms</b>
(section 2.5), so our next task is to look at
<i>Section 2.6: Different Approaches to Designing and Algorithm</i>.
</p><p>
The key idea in this section is the comparison between a
<b>top-down design</b> approach and a <b>bottom-up</b> design approach. We can
talk about that in class.
</p><p>
The discussion of <i>control structures used in algorithms</i> is already very
familiar, so you should just read through that to see how our textbook
author addresses the topic.
</p><p>
I suspect the remaining sections of the chapter will be new to you, and since
<i>time and space complexity</i> and the <i>analysis of algorithms</i> will be
central to our investigation in this course, we should spend some time on them.
I would like to have you plan a summary of this section as a class for
presentation in class on Monday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Divide up the remaining sections of this chapter:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Section 2.8: Time and Space Complexity</li>
<li>Section 2.9: Big O Notation</li>
<li>Section 2.10: Omega Notation (Ω)</li>
<li>Section 2.11: Theta Notation (Θ)</li>
<li>Section 2.12: Other Useful Notations</li>
</ul>
<p>
And prepare summaries for presentation in class on Monday. As will become our
custom, these will be evaluated using our
<a href="../resources/class_presentation_rubric.html">class presentation
rubric</a>.

<h2>Monday, February 3rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with a discussion of the following:
</p>

<h4>First Definitions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Efficient Program</dt>
<dd>
An <b>efficient program</b> is one that executes in the minimum time using
the minimum memory space.
</dd>
<dt>Data Structure</dt>
<dd>
A <b>data structure</b> is a collection of data elements grouped under one
name that are organized and stored so they can be used efficiently.
</dd>
<dt>Abstract Data Type (ADT)</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/abstractDataType.html">abstract
data type</a> (ADT) consists of a set of data values and the associated
operations which can be performed on them precisely specified independent of
any particular implementation.
</dd>
<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> is a finite
sequence of instructions used to solve a class of specific problems or to
perform a computation.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Steps for Choosing a Data Structure</h4>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the problem to determine the operations on the data that must be
supported.</li>
<li>Quantify the resource constraints for each of these operations.</li>
<li>Select the data structure that provides the required operations within
the resource constraints as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Create a new git repo for this class named <code>csc223</code> on your
favorit git host and email me a link. Please confirm that the link
on the <a href="../students.html">students page</a> (Jose's already does ;-)
from your name works once you have finished.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Chapter 2: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms</i> from
<i>Section 2.1: Basic Terminology</i> through the end of
<i>Section 2.3: Operations on Data Structures</i> (pages 43 through the
beginning of 50) in our text.
</p><p>
Create a markdown file in your new git repo named
<code>DataStructuresAlgorithmsVocab.md</code>, and put notes from your reading
in this document. Your notes should include a summary of the following ideas /
topics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>primitive vs. non-primitive data structures</li>
  <li>linear vs. non-linear data structures</li>
  <li>array</li>
  <li>linked lists</li>
  <li>stacks</li>
  <li>queues</li>
  <li>trees</li>
  <li>graphs</li>
  <li>traversing</li>
  <li>searching</li>
  <li>inserting / deleting</li>
  <li>sorting</li>
  <li>merging</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to your class summary, you'll need to have this completed file in
your git repo to earn an A for week 1.
</p><p>
We should decide together in class whether you just want to work on this
individually or if you would like to divide the sections down and present
them in class next period guided by
<a href="../resources/class_presentation_rubric.html">this</a> rubric.
