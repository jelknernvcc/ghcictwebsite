<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to <a href="https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223-DataStructuresandAnalysisofAlgorithms/detail">CSC
223: Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</a>! Since we made the jump
from 1975 forward to 2025 about a month ago there will be a lot of continuity
in our study as we move to this new course.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<p>
At the beginning of class you should create a new git repo for this class named
<code>csc223</code> on your favorit git host and email me a link. Please
confirm that the link on the <a href="../students.html">students page</a>
(Jose's already does ;-) from your name works before you leave class today.
</p><p>
We will then have a discussion of the following:
</p>

<h4>First Definitions</h4>
<dl>
<dt>Efficient Program</dt>
<dd>
An <b>efficient program</b> is one that executes in the minimum time using
the minimum memory space.
</dd>
<dt>Data Structure</dt>
<dd>
A <b>data structure</b> is a collection of data elements grouped under one
name that are organized and stored so they can be used efficiently.
</dd>
<dt>Abstract Data Type (ADT)</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/abstractDataType.html">abstract
data type</a> (ADT) consists of a set of data values and the associated
operations which can be performed on them precisely specified independent of
any particular implementation.
</dd>
<dt>Algorithm</dt>
<dd>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> is a finite
sequence of instructions used to solve a class of specific problems or to
perform a computation.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Steps for Choosing a Data Structure</h4>
<ol>
<li>Analyze the problem to determine the operations on the data that must be
supported.</li>
<li>Quantify the resource constraints for each of these operations.</li>
<li>Select the data structure that provides the required operations within
the resource constraints as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The we will then look through
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch17.html">Chapter 17: Linked
lists</a> in our textbook together and discuss the things you should pay
particular attention to as you read through it on your own during your
homework.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>
Use TDD to complete all the test cases in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch17/ch17s00.html">
Chapter 17 Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a>, reading (and <i>rereading</i>
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch17.html">the chapter</a>
as you do, with the aim of truly understanding what you read.
