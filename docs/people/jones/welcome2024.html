    <h2>Welcome to  the 2024-2025 School Year!</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
Dear Students and Families,
    <br> <br>
My name is Mr. Jones, and I am thrilled to begin the 2024 school year. I hope you have had a wonderful, restful summer and are looking forward to the new school year as much as I am.
<br> <br>
In my short education career I have taught a wide variety of computer science classes. This year, my classes will focus on <a href="../../sections/webdev/index.html">web development</a> and <a href="../../sections/ite140/index.html">databases</a>. My goal for my students is that they develop a deeper appreciation for, and critical perspective towards, the role that technology plays in our lives.
<br><br>
One of my favorite things about computer science is that it has a place in every career and discipline. Through open-ended projects, I encourage my students to be creative and to find ways to apply their technology skills to their own interests and lives.
<br> <br>
My classes are "Dual Enrolled," which means that students receive grades and credit through Northern Virginia Community College. These classes are rigorous and challenging, and I have high expectations for my students. Please read the "Dual Enrollment Expectations Contract" linked from each course homepage and reach out to me with any questions.
<br> <br>
I started my teaching career two years ago at Wakefield High School, and am transferring to the Arlington Career Center this year. My previous career was in the software industry, and I am excited to share my industry experience with my students. My goal is to be an excellent teacher, and I firmly believe that a strong partnership between school and home is essential for our students' success. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns throughout the year.
<br> <br>
Sincerely,
<br> <br>
Chris Jones <br>
Computer Science Teacher <br>
Arlington Career Center <br>
