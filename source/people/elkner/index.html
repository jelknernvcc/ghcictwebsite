<h1>Hi - I'm Jeff</h1>
<p>
I already had the best job in the world working as the computer science and
web application development teacher at the
<a href="https://careercenter.apsva.us/">Arlington Career Center</a>, and
now that job just got better since I'll be joined by
<a href="../jones/">Chris Jones</a> this year!
</p><p>
I started as a math teacher way back in 1991. That was the year both
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python
</a> were born, two things which I have been passionate about throughout my
career.
</p><p>
By the start of the 1997 school year, I was the computer science teacher at
<a href="https://yhs.apsva.us/">Yorktown High School</a>, where I remained
until moving to the
<a href="https://careercenter.apsva.us/">Arlington Career Center</a> in
the Fall of 2007. I've been at ACC ever since, helping launch Arlington
Public School's <a href="https://www.apsva.us/dual-enrollment/">Dual
Enrollment</a> program in 2009.
</p><p>
My main hobby is creating
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">open
educational resources</a>, and I started the
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/">Open Book Project</a> hosted
by <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/">ibiblio.org</a> in 1999 as a place to
put the Python resources I was making -- I know, I'm a hopeless geek ;-)  I
believe I am the first high school teacher anywhere to use Python as the
programming language in their classroom.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>
was living in Northern Virginia in those days, and he was a guest speaker in
my classroom at Yorktown.
</p><p>
The fact that my passion and my work are so initmately connected is why I say
I have the best job in the world, and this year I get to share that passion
with a colleague for the first time in my long career. Unlike Chris, I have
no prior industry experience, so I am thrilled by what it will mean for our
program to have him with us!

other times both in person and remotely by appointment.
