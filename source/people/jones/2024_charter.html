    <h2>Chris Jones - 2024 Class Charter Proposal</h2>

        <br>

    <p>We know that Psychological safety is the most important factor that makes programming teams successful. To create a psychologically safe environment, we believe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We are a diverse student group studying to enter a profession whose demographics do not match the broader population. We all take responsibility to improve this situation by respecting diversity in all its forms. We celebrate each others' backgrounds, lived experiences, and interests.</li>
        <li>We are all alternative learners. We support each classmate on their own learning journey and respect each others' needs.</li>
        <li>Albert Einstein said: <em>"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."</em> We are all trying new things and will all make mistakes. We create an environment where mistakes are allowed and are analyzed for lessons learned, and where the journey to a correct answer is worth just as much as the destination.</li>
        <li>When we work together:
            <ul>
                <li>There is never a single correct answer. We all have our own tools, ideas, and ways of working. We collaborate and learn from each other.</li>
                <li>Our teamwork encourages equitable participation, ensuring that all students, regardless of experience or confidence level, feel empowered to contribute.</li>
                <li>We support each other by contributing feedback. We accept feedback as a gift.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Our teachers, administrators, and staff are part of our class and are learners too. We accept their mistakes, support their learning process, and share our feedback.</li>
    </ul>
