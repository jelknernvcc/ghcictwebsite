### What we'll do in class

We'll start today by showing off the performance reports that we all made for the SuperStore dataset. Collaboration is a huge part of life in the world of data. I plan to start as many classes as possible with this kind of sharing, so I'm excited to get started.

After that, we'll continue playing with the SuperStore data while we explore a few important Excel functions that make this kind of summary reporting very easy:
- Sorting and Filtering
- Pivot Tables
    - Pivot Charts
    - Slicers


### Explore Weather Data
We'll practice our new skills with a new dataset! This time, I want you to imagine that you have a friend who is getting ready to move to the DCA area, and plans to stay here for life. They've asked you to tell them what the weather is like here, so you're going to make them an interactive spreadsheet.

As before, think about the kinds of questions they might ask about the data, and come up with answers. You should be able to discuss the weather in the past few years, how much the weather varies from year to year, and whether you can detect any change in the weather over time.

I've downloaded daily weather data for the past ~30 years from the [NOAA weather station at DCA](https://forecast.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KDCA.html). You can download the csv file here: [NOAA DCA Data](./data/noaa_dca_1990_2024.csv). You'll find that a lot of the column headers are cryptic, so we'll take a look at our first data dictionary, [which you can find here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cdo/documentation/GHCND_documentation.pdf).

As before, upload your completed workbook to Github. We'll start next class by sharing what we came up with.

Feel free to freestyle on this assignment by considering different geographies and/or date ranges. NOAA has tons of cool data that you can play with. You can download custom data for free at this site: [Global Historical Climatology Network](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html)


## Homework, if needed

If you felt very comfortable with today's Excel exercise, then feel free to skip today's assignment.

If you need more practice with the functions we learned today, you'll find them in Chapter 5 section 2 of [Beginning Excel 2019](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel19/front-matter/introduction/). Here is a [direct link](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel19/chapter/5-2-intermediate-table-skills/).
