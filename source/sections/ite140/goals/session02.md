### What we'll do in class

We'll approach today with an open mind. We will:
- chat about how last class's exercises went (see my solution here: [Puppies!](./puppy_project.xlsx))
- make sure we're all comfortable with basic Excel organization
- Setup our github and NOVA email accounts
- If we're comfortable with everything so far, we will:
    - Discuss a bit about Excel organization
    - play with this new dataset and practice descriptive statistics: [Super Store Sales](./SuperStoreUS-2015.xlsx)

### Instructions - MyVCCS Email

As a NOVA student, it is necessary for you to access official NOVA resources. We will use this account to access one of our digital course textbooks, your NOVA email address, and many other resources. Once you login, you may not see your email yetâ€” that's okay, and I'm working through it with NOVA.

When you registered for this class, you should have created a NOVA ID and password, and your counselor may have suggested that you take a screenshot of a yellow text box with a password. You'll need to use that password to login at [my.vccs.edu](http://my.vccs.edu). You will need to login with that password and follow those instructions to set up two-factor authentication. If you have trouble with any of this, I cannot help. You will need to contact NOVA's IT support. They are available Monday - Friday: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. by calling 703.426.4141. You may also check out [their website here](https://www.nvcc.edu/about/offices/ithd/index.html).

## Homework, if needed

If you felt very comfortable with today's Excel exercise, then feel free to skip today's assignment.

If you need more practice with basic Excel, skim through Chapter 2 of this resource: [Beginning Excel 2019](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel19/front-matter/introduction/).
