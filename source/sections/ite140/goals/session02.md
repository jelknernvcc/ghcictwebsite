## What we'll do in class

We'll approach today with an open mind. We will:
- chat about how last class's exercises went
- make sure we're all comfortable with basic Excel organization
- Setup our github and NOVA email accounts
- If we're comfortable with everything so far, we will:
    - Discuss a bit about Excel organization
    - play with this new dataset and practice descriptive statistics: [Super Store Sales](./SuperStoreUS-2015.xlsx)

## Homework, if needed

If you felt very comfortable with today's Excel exercise, then feel free to skip today's assignment.

If you need more practice with basic Excel, skim through Chapter 2 of this resource: [Beginning Excel 2019](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/beginningexcel19/front-matter/introduction/).
