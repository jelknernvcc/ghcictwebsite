Instructor notes: 
Make sure to copy the values out of the summary tab before starting simulations

Goal Seek: put in grades for each quarter, and then try to find a Sem2 Exam grade that will give an A for the year

Scenarios to Evaluate:
- C's all year
- Rough first quarter, heroic recovery

### What we'll do in class
We'll start by showing off the grade calculators that we're working on. It's okay if your grade calculator isn't perfect yet, we'll continue to work on them as we need today.

Remember, we're practicing with the storytelling part of data analysis. For this project, we're all working on recreating grade calculators for different class syllabus-es, so you should start your sharing by telling us about the class you've chosen to build a calculator for, explaining the policies, and why you chose that class. For the final version of this calculator, add a documentation sheet that explains all of this.

### Grade Calculator - What If?
In class, we'll play with Excel's What-if analysis tools. We'll briefly look at all 3 of them, but we'll focus on the goal finder and scenarios.

You're welcome to work on your own grade calculator for this part. In case it's helpful, [I've uploaded mine here](data/WebDev_Grade_Calculator.xlsx).

## Homework, if needed

Finish your grade calculator - I'll use it for your Week 3 Grade.

By Monday, I'd like everyone to have:

- A working github pages site that I can link to our course website
- A functional, polished, professional looking grade calculator that is posted to your github website. Your grade calculator must include whatever functions and organization you need to accurately calculate your course grades (including both numerical average and quality points). The grade calculator should also include:
    - A documentation tab
    - A scenario evaluation tab

If you need more practice with the functions we learned today, you can follow [the nice tutorial here:](https://www.goskills.com/Excel/Resources/What-if-analysis-Excel).
