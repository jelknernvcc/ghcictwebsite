<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Last week, everyone successfully set up their development environment and
created and linked their git repositories, so this week we are ready to
start learning Python.
</p>

<h2>Goals for Week 2</h2>
<div>
<p>
This week we want to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>pair up people with more experience with Python with those with less
(or no) experience with Python. The pairs are: Jamethiel and Marin, Fallon
and Christopher, Kaleb and Antonio, Ahmad and Julian, and Aaron and
Telmuun.</li>

<li>finish setting up our development environment.  We need to:
  <ul>
    <li>Download <a href="../../apcsp/goals/resources/dot_vimrc.txt"
    download="dot_vimrc.txt"> dot_vimrc.txt</a> and rename it to
    <code>.vimrc</code> in your home directory.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>read through <code>Chapter 3: Getting Started with Python</code> in our
text, <i>Python for Excel</i>, you should try out each of the examples
from the text, putting them in small python programs and <i>committing them
to one of your git repos</i>.</li>

<li>have each pair work on a program of their own design for homework using the
<code>datetime</code> module to be presented in class at the beginning of
next week.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Shout Outs</h2>
<div>
<p>
The shout out for week 1 goes to each and everyone of you for working
collaboratively to get all of us setup to begin our Python for Excel study this
week!
</p>

<h2>Thursday, September 8th</h2>
<div>
<p>
At the beginning of class we need to form the pairs that will work on the
<code>datetime</code> program to be presented in class on Monday, September
12th.
</p>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<p>
Use both class time and homework time to read <code>Chapter 3: Getting Started
with Python</code>, and to work on the program you and your partner will
present in class on Monday making use of the <code>datetime</code> module.
