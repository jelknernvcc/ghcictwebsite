<h2>Course Description and Purpose:</h2>
<p>
Focuses in-depth instruction in the handling of critical tasks of planning and
implementing large databases.  Includes an introduction to concepts of advanced
data warehousing and database configuration.
</p>
<p>
This is a 3 credit course which will combine class discussion with hands-on

</p>


<h2>Course Objectives:</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to
database management. The course will define essential database terms and
concepts. The emphasis of the course is on the design, development, and use of
a relational database. The student will learn the basics of drawing an
Entity-Relationship diagram (ERD) to represent user requirements, transform the
ERD to a normalized relational design, and then use Structured Query Language
(SQL) to implement and work with the database.
</p>

<h2>Curriculum Materials:</h2>
<p>
We will utilize the book, <i>Head First SQL</i>, by Lynn Beighley, available
online through the
<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.vccs.edu:2048/">
NVCC Safari Books</a> website as the core resource, supplemented with other
