<h2>Governor's Career and Technical Academy in Arlington</h2>
<h1>ITD 256: Advanced Database Management<br>Weekly Journal</h1>
</div>
</header>
<hr>

<h2>Due Date</h2>
<p>
Your weekly journal should be completed each day we have class, so if you are
absent for any reason, <i>you need to make up the class time outside of
class</i>.  It should be ready for weekly evaluation each Friday.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>
The major goal in this process is to help you <em>learn to learn</em> while
allowing you to pursue the learning objectives of Intro to IT through projects
of personal interest. Leaving this course you should be well prepared to
perform self directed investigation and study in the future, and to document
your results. Skills which will make your future colleagues and employers
<i>very</i> happy!
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
Each week will create a new journal entry linked from your digital portfolio.
Working either alone or with a partner or group (depending on the project),
you should document each of the following parts of a successful learning
process:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Investigation</th>
  <th>&lt;---&gt;</th>
  <th>Reflection</th>
  <th>&lt;---&gt;</th>
  <th>Experimentation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>(Look it up)</td>
  <td></td>
  <td>(Think about it)</td>
  <td></td>
  <td>(Try it out)</td>
</tr>
</table>
