## What we'll do in class
We'll continue playing with [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) to motivate our exploration of single-table SELECT statements. Last time we got pretty comfortable with SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. 

Today we'll add a few new keywords:

- GROUP BY and HAVING
- LIMIT
- Functions (Aggregation vs Scalar Functions)

Then, we'll learn how to use SQL on Python Dataframes.

## Homework, if needed
Going forward, I'll expect that you're comfortable with everything we've done in class today. I strongly recommend practicing with these concepts on your own. You might want to go through the [Nobel Prize Winners Practice on SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SELECT_from_Nobel_Tutorial), which uses the same concepts on a new table.
