## What we'll do in class
We'll continue to explore JOINs. With the syntax that we have so far, we can write some pretty powerful SQL queries. We'll take a break from learning new syntax to focus on writing interesting SQL queries.

We'll start by coming up with some interesting questions, and then figure out how to write queries to answer them.

Along the way, we'll talk about some helpful SQL techniques and patterns.

I've thought about a bunch of interesting questions based on the [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) data. If we complete this, we'll also work through some interesting questions based on senate data on this website: [Select Start SQL](https://selectstarsql.com/questions.html) (and if you're looking for another great reference about basic sql queries, I highly recommend this one!)


## Homework
Write one new, interesting query using any of the datasets that we've explored today. Start by asking a question, and then figure out how to write the query to answer it. Be prepared to share at the beginning of next class!

The goal here is to practice curiosity and critical thinking about datasets. We want to be able to come up with lots of interesting questions when we're presented with a new dataset!
