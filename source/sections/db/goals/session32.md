## What we'll do in class

### Postgres!

We're connecting to our Postgres server today! 

First, we'll need to install `psql`, [following these instructions](https://github.com/pyrox0/brew-easy-install)

Depending on how long that takes, we'll work through some postgres examples together.

We'll reference:
- this handy [Postgres Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546)
- [Postgres Data Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html)
