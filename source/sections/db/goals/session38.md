## What we'll do in class
Continue project work  
[See the full write-up for this project here](https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/db/projects/project.html?id=02final)

As promised, we'll have our second check-in today. This one will be one-on-one - I'll come around and check in to make sure that everyone is making good progress on your project!

My plan is to work on this project in class today and Thursday, and then for the project to be due in class (with presentations) on Monday - we'll present our projects on Monday.

Also, If you didn't complete course evaluations yet, please do!

To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.
