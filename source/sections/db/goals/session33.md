## What we'll do in class

### Postgres!

We're connecting to our Postgres server today! 

First, we'll need to install `psql`, [following these instructions](https://github.com/pyrox0/brew-easy-install)

...And it turned out that this took the whole class. We'll continue playing with Postgres next class =)
