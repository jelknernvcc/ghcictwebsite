## What we'll do in class

### Postgres!

Today, we'll work through creating databases, schema, and tables on Postgres. We'll briefly discuss permissions and data types as we encounter them.

We'll reference:
- this handy [Postgres Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/Kartones/dd3ff5ec5ea238d4c546)
- [Postgres Data Types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html)

### Activity: Create some tables from your app schema
In Sessions 31 and 32, you worked on creating a database schema. Now we'll make it real. The goal is for everyone to create tables in your own database.

## Homework
If you didn't get to it in class, please have at least two tables with a FK relationship made by the beginning of next class.
