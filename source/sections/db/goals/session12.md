## Lesson Objectives
By the end of today's lesson, you should:
- Be comfortable working with data in Pandas
- Be able to create data visualizations using Seaborn
- Have a professional-looking Jupyter Notebook to share

## What we'll do in class
We didn't finish our Pandas/Seaborn activity last class, so we'll keep working on it today. Our goal will be to start class on Thursday with presentations.

## Start researching about our Arlington 2050 Project
There are a lot of new topics that we'll need to learn about for our Arlington 2050 Project.

To help us learn, let's break down these topics. Everyone should sign up to become our "Subject matter expert" ("SME") on one of the topics below. As the SME, your responsibility is to help us understand the topic, why it's important, and how it works.

In class on Tuesday, we'll learn about these topics by presenting them to each-other. Each person should plan to present for ~8 minutes about what you've learned.

During your presentation, you should:
- Give us an introduction to the topic
- Give us some concrete, simple examples that will help us understand
- Show us a Jupyter notebook with some working Python code

These are all very deep topics, and your goal is to give us a general overview. Don't get bogged down in the inner-workings of specific algorithms or choosing the best Python package.

Your presentation should show us that you're knowledgeable about the topic, but it's very okay if you show examples, code, or visuals that are not your own. Just be sure to cite your sources and give credit to original authors when necessary!
