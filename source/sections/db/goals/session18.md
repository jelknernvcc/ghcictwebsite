## Lesson Objectives
We'll start today by sharing the word cloud outputs that we got last time. Let's start compiling these outputs in [these google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zFABvqd1Fw3owguRCrZi2I1pqQ6oz_dBwPXGr2riiSk/edit?usp=sharing) (You'll need to be logged into your VCCS email account to access them).

If you're still working on loading the data, you can take a look [at my code here](https://github.com/MrJonesAPS/ITE140/blob/main/2050/load_concatenated_text.ipynb)

Next, let's start playing with SpaCy for sentiment analysis. Here are some tasks that we'll work through:
- Assign a sentiment and a polarity to every comment in your dataset
- Again, we'll want to be able to break down by source - how does the sentiment of people at the county fair compare to people who responded on the website?
- Miguel's [Sentiment analysis code is here](https://github.com/Miguel-Vargas-07/ite140/blob/main/SentimentAnalyses.ipynb)
- Graph these in a histogram [Use this Seaborn Histogram tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/how-to-make-a-seaborn-histogram)

Depending on time, we might also start to play with vector embeddings and semantics. In case it's helpful, here are [Blu's notes about vector embeddings](https://github.com/1bMedina/ite140/blob/main/notebooks/word2vec.ipynb)
