## What we'll do in class

### Normalization Presentations
We'll start by presenting our work from last week's normalization assignment.

### Data Modelling
We'll transition to start talking about data modelling.

Before we get into theory, we'll spend some time working through examples.

We'll do one example together, and then we'll break into groups to practice more examples.

### A look ahead
Over the next two weeks, we'll focus on data modeling, and then turning those
models into real databases. Our goal will be to have our own working databases 
before we leave for winter break.

## Homework - review ER diagram theory
There's a lot of vocabulary to the process of data modelling. I'd like you to know it, 
so please [review this chapter before next class](https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/chapter/chapter-8-entity-relationship-model/).
