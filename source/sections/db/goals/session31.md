## What we'll do in class

### Data Modeling Practice

At the end of last class, we broke up into two groups to try to create our own data models based on apps on our phones. Here are the groups:

- Miguel, Lehiem, Rachael - Instagram
- Adam, Alex, Blu - Chipotle

Both groups were having great discussions and had more work to do. I want to give this activity the time it needs, so we'll resume and keep working next class. Whenever we're finished, we'll share.

### Data Modeling - Django Apps

Blu will share about a few projects coming up this year. We'll break into groups and try to come up with some preliminary data models for these projects.
