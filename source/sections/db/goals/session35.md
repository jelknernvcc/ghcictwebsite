## What we'll do in class

### Postgres!

Today, we'll continue practicing with ER diagramming and Postgres database setup.

First, we'll have a brief discussion of **idempotency**, and easier ways to write our scripts outside of the command line.

Our goal today is to work on database design for the `Django Girls` projects that Blu introduced us to last week.

There are three projects here, so we'll break into groups, design ER diagrams, and then work on implementing them in Postgres.

## Homework

Enjoy your break, but feel free to continue working on your database design. We'll finish this, with the goal of handing it over, shortly after we get back.
