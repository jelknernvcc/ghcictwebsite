## Substitute Today
Hi Everyone - I have to attend an all-day training today, so you'll have a substitute. Here's what I'd like you to work on:

### Make sure your grade calculators are posted to GitHub
For everyone who has your grade calculator posted to GitHub, I've entered your week 3 grades.

A few folks don't have your calculators posted to github yet, so I wasn't able to give you a grade (i've entered "missing" for now, but I'll update it when it's posted). Spend some time today practicing with git and making sure that your grade calculator project is in your repo. There are some git pros in this group, so ask your peers for help if you need it! And [here's a helpful tutorial that you might want to read through](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/).

### Continue reading Python for Excel

We're continuing with the Python for Excel text today. In case it helps, [here's a direct link to the textbook that I think should work better](https://vcc-nvc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01VCC_NVC/r9ee24/alma99391307904386). If that doesn't work, you can login to [my.vccs.edu](my.vccs.edu), click the link that says "Quick Search Library Catalog", and search for "Python for Excel" there.

Hopefully you got a chance to read through the chapter about NumPy. 

Just like last time, I'm expecting that you're reading in the book, taking notes in a Jupyter notebook (formatted nicely with Markdown), embedding some helpful Python examples, and committing your notebook to your github repo.

This time, you'll start to read about [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a very useful data analytics package that is built on top of NumPy. Pandas is introduced in chapter 5, which is quite long. So you don't need to read all of it.

Don't forget to `pip install pandas`

#### Here are the specific sections that I want you to read:
- DataFrame and Series
- Data Manipulation
- Descriptive Statistics and Data Aggregation:
    - Descriptive Statistics
    - Grouping

#### For now, you can skip:
- The sections about `MultiIndex`
- Combining DataFrames
- Pivoting and Melting
- Plotting, and everything that comes after that

#### Key Points
Here are a few key points that I want you to focus on and highlight in your notes:
- What is the relationship between NumPy series and Pandas DataFrames?
- What makes indexes in Pandas different from the rest of the data?
- How do you access rows, columns, and values in a DataFrame using index and using boolean conditions?
- How do you get descriptive statistics, and how can you filter ("slice") those statistics by row, column, or value?


## Homework

### Finish Jupyter Notebooks

By class on Monday, I'll expect that you have two Jupyter Notebooks (one about NumPy and another about Pandas) committed to your GitHub. This will count as your Week 4 grade.
