<h2>What to do:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Choose a partner.  This is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>
assignment.  Two programmers will work together on one computer and submit
one program.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Write a Python program named <code>get_fruites.py</code> that asks the user for
the name of a fruit that they like.  Then ask them for nine more.  Store these
fruits, one per line, in a text file named <code>fruit_list.txt</code>.</p>
<p>
A sample session might look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
$ python3 get_fruits.py 
Please enter the name of a fruit you like to eat: cherries
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: blueberries
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: bananas
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: oranges
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: peaches
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: apples
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: strawberries
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: mangos
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: kiwis
Please enter the name of another fruit you like to eat: rasberries
$
</pre>
<p>
After which, the <code>fruit_list.txt</code> file should exist and contain
the following:
</p>
<pre>
cherries
blueberries
bananas
oranges
peaches
apples
strawberries
mangos
kiwis
rasberries
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Write a program named <code>show_fruits.py</code> that displays an 
introductory sentence and then the list of fruits in
<code>fruit_list.txt</code> enumerated.  A sample run of the program with the
fruits entered in the previous example might look like this:
<pre>
$ show_fruits.py
Here is a list of the fruits you said you like to eat:

  1. cherries
  2. blueberries
  3. bananas
  4. oranges
  5. peaches
  6. apples
  7. strawberries
  8. mangos
  9. kiwis
  10. rasberries
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Write a program named <code>show_sorted_fruits.py</code> that displays an 
introductory sentence and then the list of fruits in
<code>fruit_list.txt</code> enumerated in alphabetical order.  A sample run of
the program with the fruits entered in the preceding example might look like
this:
<pre>
$ show_sorted_fruits.py
Here is a list of the fruits you said you like to eat:

  1. apples
  2. bananas
  3. blueberries
  4. cherries
  5. kiwis
  6. mangos
  7. oranges
  8. peaches
