<h2>Chapter 5: <a

Saving User Input: Testing the Database</a></h2>

<p>Answer the following questions</p>
<ol>

unexpected failures in functional tests?</li>

<li>What is a CSRF? How did we protect against it in the application we
are building?</li>

<li>What is a <b>POST request</b>? How are we using it in our application?</li>

<li>What is a <b>regression</b>? What regression did we encounter in this
chapter and how did our tests help us uncover it?</li>

<li>What specific example of <b>triangulation</b> do we use in this chapter?
Why does the author say he prefers this to the <i>eliminate duplication</i>
methodology as an approach to <b>Red/Green/Refactor</b>?</li>

<li>What is a <b>code smell</b>? Use web resources to help you come up with a
definition <i>in your own words</i>.</li>

<li>What is an <b>ORM</b>? Use web resources to help you come up with a
definition <i>in your own words</i>. Which new file do we modify for the first
time as we begin to work with our ORM?</li>

<li>According to our author, what is the charge of the <b>migrations</b>
system? How does this relate to / differ from the job of the ORM? Which new
Django command do we use to activate the migrations system?</li> 

<li>Looking at the new unit test class, <code>ItemModelText</code>, what can
you say about the <i>type</i> of <code>saved_items</code>? Explain your
reasoning.</li>

<li>Our author says that classes that inherit from <code>models.Model</code>
are mapped to what? Relate your answer to the first two questions you answered
above.</li>

<li>In the section <i>Saving the POST to the Database</i>, we add modify the

questions about that method:
<ol>
  <li>What type is the <code>data</code> parameter passed to the
  <code>self.client.post</code> method?</li>

  <li>To understand what is going on here, it is helpful to look at
  <code>'item_text'</code> to see what it is doing. Run the following
  command at the bash prompt inside your <code>python-tdd-book</code>
  directory:
  <pre>
  $ egrep -R item_text *</pre>

</ol>
</li>

<li>Explain the difference between <code>makemigrations</code> and

<h2>Chapter 6: <a
href="https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_explicit_waits_1.html">
Improving Functional Tests: Ensuring Isolation and Removing Voodoo Sleeps</a>
</h2>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does the author mean by <i>isolation</i> between tests? Students in
our database class have been introduced the the term <i>idempotent</i> (a nice
mathematical term). Can you relate this term to what we are doing here?  Look
up <i>idempotency</i> as it relates to <i>REST API</i>s to help with your
answer here.</li>

<li>What does <code>LiveServerTestCase</code> give us that we didn't have
before?  What <i>is</i> <code>LiveServerTestCase</code> anyway? Explain how you
know.</li>

<li>Describe <i>in detail</i> what these three commands are doing:<pre>
  $ mkdir functional_tests
  $ touch functional_tests/__init__.py
  $ git mv functional_tests.py functional_tests/tests.py
</pre></li>

<li>Discuss the difference between <i>implicit</i> and <i>explicit</i> waits.
What does the author say are some of the problems with each approach?</li>

<li>Read Martin Fowler's <a
href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/nonDeterminism.html"> Eradicating
Non-Determinism in Tests</a>. According to the article, what is a
  <i>non-deterministic test</i>? What are the two problems Martin ascribes to
them? What is the first piece of advice Martin gives as to how to handle
non-deterministic tests?</li>

<li>Summarize each of the following concept's from Martin Fowler's article in
your own words (Good summaries should be short and clear):
<ul class="vocablist">
  <li>lack of isolation</li>
  <li>asynchronous behavior</li>
  <li>remote services</li>
  <li>time</li>
  <li>resource leaks</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Explain <i>in detail</i> what caused each of the two functional test errors
we intentially caused at the end of this chapter. Why do you think the author
asked you to make them?</li>
</ol>

<article id="ch7">
<h2>Chapter 7: <a
href="https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/chapter_working_incrementally.html">
Working Incrementally</a></h2>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What does the author mean by <i>Big Design Up Front</i> and how is the
agile movement a reaction against this? Instead of a long up-front design
phase, what does the agile philosophy strive to achieve early in the
development process and why?</li>

<li>Explain the YAGNI tenent. What it means and why it is a principle of agile
software development.</li>

<li>Expand upon what the author says in the <i>REST (ish)</i> section. Which of
the three parts of our MVC architecture does he say we already understand? Does
this make sense to you? That leaves the other two parts. How does the author go
about approaching these?</li>

<li>Describe the relationship between <b>URLs</b> and building Django
application <b>UIs</b>.  Break down in explicit detail the URL design the
author proposes for our ToDo list application, and how this is <q>RESTish</q>.
Describe how we use the <code>assertRegex</code> method from the
<code>unittest</code> module to enforce this.</li>

<li>Discuss in detail the items in the chapter 7 <i>scratchpad</i> the author
presents at the end of the <b>REST (ish)</b> section. Where will these URLs be
added? Describe the process.</li>

<li>Explain how our author approaches the problem of ensuring we have a
regression test and what this means in the context of our application.</li>

<li>Lay out the author's approach to using TDD to implement a new design.
Explain it in your own words and relate it to the flowchart presented (which
now adorns the wall in our classroom as well).</li>

<li>In the section <i>Iterating Towards the New Design</i>, our author states:
<blockquote>
Another way of thinking about it is as a problem-solving technique: our new URL
design is currently not implemented, so it works for 0 items. Ultimately, we
want to solve for n items, but solving for 1 item is a good step along the way.
</blockquote>
Since integration with our math curriculum is one of the educational goals of
this course, relate this statement to perhaps the most powerful tool in the
mathematian's toolbox for proving statements about the natural numbers,
<b>the principle of mathematical induction</b>.</li>

<li>This chapter contains the first time we handle a new URL (other than '/').
Describe in detail the full process we use for doing that. Which files need to
be changed?  How?</li>

<li>Describe in detail the process of getting our new URL,
<code>/lists/the-only-list-in-the-world/</code> to pass our original functional
test. Why does it pass the original one but not the new one?</li>

<li>The rest of the chapter is spent iterating toward a design that supports
seperate lists for seperate list items. Summarize the steps involved in this
process. Pay particular attention to the step in which we adjust our models to
reflect our new design.</li>

<ol>
<li>Discuss how the author says we should approach testing the appearance of
our application. How does he say we can use TDD to test our aesthetics?
(see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRb066DjOav6bZ3D0M8cnNDqyMS_GydYGPI6LsbJWdH0Q9sqKYKdTb4KptodW-glWme6vR03wD7BZFt/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p1">

<li>Summarize the <q>Deployment Chapters Overview</q> in your own words to
help you get a clearer picture of where we are going on this journey to a

<li>Our author makes a point of distinguishing between running tests

staging server.  Why do you think this distinction is important?</li>

<li>When I run: <code>$ python manage.py test functional_tests</code> my
functional tests all pass, but when I run <code>$
STAGING_SERVER=todo-staging.elkner.net python manage.py test functional_tests
