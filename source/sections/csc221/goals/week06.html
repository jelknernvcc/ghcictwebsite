<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
After class on Monday, our co-teacher Chris mentioned to me that the solution
I shared for <code>lots_of_letters</code>:
</p>
<pre>
def lots_of_letters(word):
    s = ''
    for i in range(1, len(word) + 1):
        s += i * word[i-1]
    return s
</pre>
<p>
Could be improved:
</p>
<pre>
def lots_of_letters(word):
    s = ''
    for index, letter in enumerate(word):
        s += (index + 1) * letter 
    return s
</pre>
<p>
Study this example. It is indeed a big improvement over the first solution,
since it is clearly more
<q><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/pythonic/">pythonic</a></q>.
Python can be a beautiful language, especially in the hands of programmers who
know how to use it.
</p><p>
We will start class today with presentations by
Gizelle and Erij of the <code>replace</code> function from
excercise set 2 exercise 7, and by Chris and Antoan of
the <code>find_mode</code> function from exercise set 0 exercise 9.
</p><p>
After that I want to present a few short topics inspired by a conversation I
had with Lucy in class last Thursday:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace">Namespaces</a> and
the <code>dir()</code> function (with a big shoutout to Tim Peters for his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">Zen of Python</a>.)</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring">Docstrings</a> and
<a href="https://blog.finxter.com/what-is-__-doc-__-in-python/">__doc__</a>
(with another shoutout to Tim Peters for using these for
 <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">doctests</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/exercises/ch05/ch05s05.html">

<h2>Monday, September 30th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Due to the unplanned interruption of class last Thursday, we will play catch
up today. I will start things off with the promised presentation on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exception
handling</a> in Python.
</p><p>
Then the four students who did make it to class last Thursday will present the
exercises they chose in class that day. Everyone else will pair up and choose
exercises to present in class on Wednesday.
</p><p>
Lucy and Lary will share their solution to exercise set 1, practice set 2,
exercise 5: <code>sum_of_squares_of_digits</code>. Delaine and Sean F.
will share their solution to exercise set 2, doctest practice set 3,
exercise 2: <code>lots_of_letters</code>.
