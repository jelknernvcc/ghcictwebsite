<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to 2nd Quarter! With the PCEP now behind us, it's time for the promised
<i>flip</i> in how we conduct class. Tests and quizzes are out, programs and
presentations are in! We will now move from learning to <i>read</i> Python
code to learning to <i>write</i> it.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
At the beginning of the year I shared a little program with you,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc221/raw/branch/master/choosers/choose_pairs.py">
choose_pairs.py</a> that randomly pairs you with classmates in our class. Well,
we've come a long way since then, and you should now be able to read this
program and understand it.
</p><p>
I ran it over our long weekend, and it gave the following output for our first
assignment of 2nd quarter:
</p><pre>
Pairs for the Python Course
============================
Erij will pair with Sean.
Chris will pair with Lucy.
Delaine will pair with Giselle.
Poor Lary will have to work with one of the teachers.
</pre><p>
During the first part of class, I will use
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch07.html">Chapter 7:
Classes and objects</a> to introduce Python's syntax for creating programmer
defined objects.
</p><p>
You will be introduced to several new vocabulary words, including
<b>class</b>, <b>instance</b>, <b>data attribute</b>, <b>method</b>,
<b>instance</b>, <b>instantiation</b>, <b>initialization method</b>,
<b>operator overloading</b>, and <b>polymorphism</b>.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
After we discuss the chapter, you will work with your partner to complete
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/exercises/ch07/ch07s00.html">
Exercise Set 0: Chapter Review</a>.  While you will collaborate with your
partner on writing the exercise solutions, <i>you each need to commit your
own code to your own git repository</i>.
