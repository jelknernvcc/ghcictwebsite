<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
With your git repos set up and ready to go, this week we will dive right into
Python development.
</p>

<h2>Friday, September 8th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
It was overly ambitious to think we could get through 
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/2-tables.html">
Sheet 2: Turning the Tables</a> in one class period. We did acheive the main
goal on Wednesday, however, establishing the <i>workflow</i> you will use in
class all year, including the <i>git add... git commit... git push...</i>
<q>dance</q>.
</p><p>
Today in class you will work in groups at your table to apply the process you
learned on Wednesday on your own. Continue working on sheet 2, developing the
<code>mathquiz.py</code> program, and solving each of the challenges possed
along the way. Be sure to commit each challenge to your repo.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Your evaluation this week will be based on the commit history in your repo.
An A for the week will be earned if several commits are made throughout the
class period showing continued progress in sheet 2.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

from
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/tutorials/getdown/unix/">Getting Down
with the Unix CLI</a>, and practicing each of the commands introduced, until
you feel you are ready to use <code>ls</code> (with options), <code>pwd</code>,
<code>cd</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>rmdir</code>, <code>rm</code>,
<code>cp</code>, and <code>mv</code> to manage files in the file system.
</p><p>
Also use <code>vimtutor</code> to develop comfort with this powerful text
editor.

<h2>Wednesday, September 6th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today in class we will complete
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/2-tables.html">
Sheet 2: Turning the Tables</a> together.  This will give me a chance to
model the software development workflow, together with the git
<i>add-commit-push</i> dance.
</p><p>
Before we dive into the sheet, we will do one last bit of configuration of
our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment">development
environment</a>.  We will add a file named <code>.vimrc</code> that configures
vim to be an excellent Python
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE
</a>.
</p><p>
Follow the instructions
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/pybiblio/tips/elkner/vim4python.php">here
</a> to set this up on your computer.

<h3>Evaluation</h3>

<p>
At the end of this lesson, you should have a series of commits in your
git repository corresponding to what we did together in class, ending with a
working version of the <code>mathquiz.py</code> program.
