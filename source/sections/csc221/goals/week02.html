<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will begin
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch02.html">Chapter 2:
Values, expressions and statements</a> in our online textbook. By the end of
this chapter, you should be comfortable interacting with the Python
interpreter in both shell mode and script mode. You will also need to be
comfortable using the Unix CLI and a console text editor, so be sure to reach
out to me for help if you can't do any of those things.
</p>

<h2>Friday, September 6th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we will discuss the solutions to the homework assigned
on Wednesday, and then learn how to use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest">doctest</a> module to write
automated tests.
</p><p>
I will be using doctests frequently on quizzes as a way to assess your
understanding of Python.
</p><p>
Finally, I'll show you how to add a
<a href="../resources/dot_vimrc.txt" download=".vimrc">.vimrc</a> file
to your home directory which will begin to turn vim into a nice Python
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">
IDE</a>.

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Prepare for your first test on chapter 2 at the beginning of class next
Tuesday (the 10th) by completing the exercises in
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/exercises/ch02/ch02s01.html">Exercise Set 1: Introducting Doctest</a>. Four of the five questions on

During the first half of class today I will go through
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch02.html">Chapter 2:
Values, expressions and statements</a> in our textbook, running many of the
examples and summarizing many of the key ideas presented in the chapter.

By the time we finish reading this chapter, you should become familiar with the
following terms, and be able to provide a rough definition of them:
</p><blockquote>
data, value, data type, class, bit, int, str, float, '\n', Python shell,
Python script, expression, operator, operand, assignment statement,
assignment operator, modulus operator, converter functions, input function,
print function

Set 1: Introducing Doctest</a> to get you started with this wonderful tool.

<p>
If you haven't already done so, read
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch02.html">Chapter 2:
Values, expressions and statements</a> in our online textbook. Remember, you
are a college student now, so you should be <i>reading for understanding</i>.
You can test your understanding by seeing how easily you can complete some
of the exercises in
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/exercises/ch02/ch02s00.html">Exercise
Set 0: Chapter Review</a>. I'll show you in class where you can look for
solutions to these exercises.
