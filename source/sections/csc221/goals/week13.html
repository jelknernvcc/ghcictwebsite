<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will tack on Monday, November 25th to this <q>week</q>, and then have
week 15 when we return from Thanksgiving break. We will use this time to
complete our introduction to object-oriented programming in Python.

<h2>Monday, November 25th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class revisiting the topic of programming project evaluation that
I discussed with you at the beginning of the second quarter. Current grade
distribution in our class is: <b>A</b>: 4, <b>B</b>: 1, <b>C</b>: 1,
<b>D</b>:1, and <b>E</b>: 2.  I know we can do better than that, and I suspect
the main reason that we are not doing better is that several of you have yet to
understand how project evaluation using revision control works.
</p><p>
After that we will finish our study of
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/5-robots.html">
The Robots are Coming!</a>
</p><p>
We'll look at two versions of the project:
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc221/src/branch/master/gasp_lessons/student_work/seanfbots.py" download="seanfbots.py">seanfbots.py</a>,
by our own Sean Finnegan, and the incomplete OO remix,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc221/src/branch/master/gasp_lessons/robots.py" download="robots.py">
robots.py</a>, by yours truly.

<h3>Classwork</h3>

<p>
I was delighted when I looked through most of your git repos, but I did come
across a few things that need to be fixed.
</p><p>
Let's take a look at the commits of Sean F.
<a href="https://codeberg.org/sfinnegan/csc221/src/branch/main/robots.py">
Sean F.</a>, 
<a href="https://codeberg.org/djones/csc221/src/branch/main/Projects/robots.py">
Delanie</a>,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/gterrazas4/csc221/src/branch/main/robots.py">

and I want to use time at the beginning of class today to talk about why.

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>
The remainder of class time and your homework time should be used in working
