<h2>Overview</h2>

week 15 when we return from Thanksgiving break. We will use this time to
complete our introduction to object-oriented programming in Python.

<h2>Monday, November 25th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin class revisiting the topic of programming project evaluation that
I discussed with you at the beginning of the second quarter. Current grade
distribution in our class is: <b>A</b>: 4, <b>B</b>: 1, <b>C</b>: 1,
<b>D</b>:1, and <b>E</b>: 2.  I know we can do better than that, and I suspect
the main reason that we are not doing better is that several of you have yet to
understand how project evaluation using revision control works.
</p><p>
After that we will finish our study of
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/pybiblio/gasp/course/5-robots.html">
The Robots are Coming!</a>.

development with

I was delighted when I looked through most of your git repos, but I did come
across a few things that need to be fixed.

Let's take a look at the commits of Sean F.
