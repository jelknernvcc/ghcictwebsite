<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This is it, the last week of <i>CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
Programming</i>! We explored <i>a lot</i> this semester, and you are leaving
this course with a better understanding of what computer programs are and what
they can do, and with a solid advanced beginner's level knowledge of the
Python programming language. We'll tack on next Tuesday to this last week. When
you come in at the start of February, you will be in <i>ITP 225: Web Scripting
Language</i>. 
</p><p>
That said, from a practical point of view you won't feel any difference, since
we've fused these two courses together in our study plan, and have already
made the transition from this course, with its introduction to Python to the
next one, in which we will use the large Python web application framework
Django to learn to build web applications.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Let's begin with a quick look back at where we have been recently:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We did a brief study of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> and learned how to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite">SQLite</a> to create and query
database tables.</li>

<li>We learned about
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/db/models/">Django
Models</a> and how the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM
</a> enables us to write Python code which controls our application's data
base.</li>

<li>During your last homework assignment, you were introduced to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">
MVC</a> software design pattern and how Django implements this pattern in its
own unique (and somewhat confusing) way.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We will begin class today with the promised quiz on your homework lectures,
after which we will take another look at Dr. Chuck's <q>big picture</q>
diagram:

in the light of our new understanding.
