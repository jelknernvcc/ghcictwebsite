<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="standout"> 
Welcome to Computer Science 221!
</p><p>
This week we get oriented to our learning environment, and begin to establish
the processes we will use to learn together. Specifically, we need to get
started with:
</p>
<ol class="details">
<li><b>Communications tools and protocols.</b> How do we meet communicate,
share information, and work together? My goal will be to find ways of
communicating that are as unobtrusive as possible, so that we can focus on
learning to program, the raison d'etre of our being here.
</li>

<li><b>Skills and tools for software development.</b> In order to develop
software, it is first necessary to learn to manage your computer using
the computer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">
command-line interface</a> (CLI), including learning to use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console">console</a> based
text editor, which for us will be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a>.</li>

<li><b>Revision control.</b> We will use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a> as both a software
development tool and a commuications tool. You will <q>submit</q> all of your
work for evaluation through your git repository.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Today in class we will work toward the following goals:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen</a> to
create an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a> public
and private key pair, upload the public key to your git host, and then clone
the git repository you made last class to your local computer.</li>

<li>Introduce you to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and walk you
through the git <i>add - commit - push</i> cycle using your
<code>README.md</code> to practice with.</li>

<li>Discuss the Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> commands
you will need to learn and prepare you for your homework.</li>
</ol>
