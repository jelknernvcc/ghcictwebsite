<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="standout"> 
Welcome to Computer Science 221!
</p><p>
We'll start this week by discussing the goals and expectations for this course,
and how they fit in with the broader objectives of our computer science
and web development sequences. After that will dive right in to learning
Python.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Check out the first item under <b>Resources</b> on our
<a href="../index.html">class homepage</a> to see a link to the <b>Terminus</b>
game that Chris told us about in class on Tuesday. This seems to be a great
way to begin learning the Unix CLI.
</p><p>
We will begin class today by finishing the setup of our git repos that we began
last class. For the remainder of class I will summarize the important ideas
from <a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch01.html">Chapter
1: Why program?</a> in our text.
</p><p>
By the end of class you should understand:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the four things computers do</li>

<li>how information is represented in a computer</li>

<li>what a computer program is</li>

<li>why Python is a <b>high-level</b>, <b>interpreted</b> programming
language</li>

<li>the difference between <b>shell mode</b> and <b>script mode</b> in running
Python code</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/ch01.html">Chapter 1:
Why program?</a> and complete
<a href="https://www.openbookproject.net/books/bpp4awd/exercises/ch01/ch01s00.html#ch01s00">the
exercises</a> at the end of the chapter.

<h2>Tuesday, August 27th</h2>
<p>
Today we will discuss course objectives and class expectations.
</p>

<h3>Communication Tools and Protocols</h3>
<div>
<p>
As an NVCC college student, the expectation is that you will use your VCCS
email address to communicate with me, and that is what I want you to do. I know
that you will often want to use other channels to communicate with each other
for pair and group work. That's fine.
</p><p>
But if you want to communicate <i>with me</i> about anything, scheduling an
office hour meeting to get help, expressing concerns about your grades or
anything related to our class, <i>email me</i> from your VCSS email address to
my VCCS email address. I will commit to check VCSS email at the start of each
day, and unless unexpected circumstances arise (which I'm sure they
occassionally will) to respond to you within 24 hours.
</p><p>
Your first homework assignment will require you to send me an email
<i>from your VCSS email</i> answering a set of questions about your previous
programming background and the goals and expectations you have for taking
this course.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Skills and Tools for Python Software Development</h3> 
<div>
<p>
We are going to be moving fast is in this course to get you ready to pass
the <a href="https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep">PCEP</a> certification exam by
the end of the first quarter. Almost your entire grade this first quarter
(excluding the credit you earn for the first homework assignment) will come
from the test scores from the frequent practice tests you will take
throughout the quarter.
</p><p>
It is assumed that you already have the <a href="prerequisits">prerequisit
skills</a> which you should have aquired in the previous course, including
comfort using a Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">command-line
interface</a> (CLI), a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_console">console</a> based
text editor (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a>
in particular), and using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git</a>
and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities">
git host</a>
as both a software development and commuications tool. I will be using these
tools during presentations in class. If you do not know how to use them, I can
make time to work with you <i>outside of class</i> during my frequent <i>office
hours</i> to help you learn them, but we will not have time to learn them in
class.
</p><p>
During the second half of class, I will walk you through instructions for
<a href="../../../resources/git_on_codeberg">creating an account on
Codeberg</a>. You will email me a link to your repo for this class as part of
your homework assignment.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
<i>Using your VCCS email account</i>, send me an email to my VCCS email
address: <code>jde232@email.vccs.edu</code> introducing yourself to me by
answering the following questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your past experience with with the Unix CLI, console based text
editors like Vim, and revision control using git?</li>

<li>What is your previous programming experience? Which programming languages,
if any, do you know?  How well do you feel you know them? With which
programming environments do you have experience?</li>

<li>What motivated you to sign up for this course, and what are you hoping
to get out of it? Please be as specific as you can.</li>

<li>Understanding that this will be a rigerous, challenging course, do you
feel you are interested in and dedicated to it enough to put in the time you
will need to be successful?</li>

<li>Is there anything you would like to see in a <i>Classroom Charter</i> 
containing the rules and norms we all agree together to abide in our learning
community?</li>

<li>What is the url of the git repo you created for this class?</li>
</ol>

<p style="color: red;">
<b>Due:</b> Email this assignment to me by 4 pm on Wednesday so that I have
time to reply before our class on Thursday.
</p><p>
<b>Evaluation</b>: This first assignment will be worth half the normal test
grade that will make up your grade during first quarter. An <b>A</b> will be
earned for specific, detailed, and thoughful answers to my questions. <b>B</b>
will be earned if all questions are answered, but specific details are lacking.
<b>C</b> will be earned for answering most questions, and <b>D</b> will
be earned for sending me an email.
