<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we learn about the last new data type we will see before the
PCEP exam: the Python dictionary.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, October 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We now know all the Python we need to know to prepare for the
<a href="https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep">PCEP exam</a>. Starting now you
will be given time to complete the
<a href="https://edube.org/study/pe1">Python Essentials 1</a> course on your
own. This course will prepare you for the certification exam, since it was
made by the vendor who made the exam.
</p><p>
I have a collection of
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc221/src/branch/master/PCEP/Questions">
129 practice problems</a> you can use in addition to the problems given in
the OpenEDG course.  <i>All</i> of these exercises are now fair game for
short quizzes we will have in class.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with the promised quiz on chapter 5.
</p><p>
After our quiz I will provide an introduction the last Python data type we
need before taking the PCEP, the
<a href="https://realpython.com/python-dicts/">dictionary</a>.
</p><p>
After demonstrating this new data type and showing you several of its methods,
I'll discuss an example inspired by a conversation I had with Delanie and
Sean last Wednesday.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <a href="https://realpython.com/python-dicts/">Dictionaries in Python</a>,
trying the example code yourself and making sure you understand how they work.
