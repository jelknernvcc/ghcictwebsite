## What We'll Do In Class

### Websites

We'll start by sharing what we have so far for `Book Jeff` (see last class's page for the assignment details). We'll have each group show off how the design and implementation process are going.


### CSS Alignment Tips

We'll adapt this part based on how the presentations go. We'll try to find themes that all of the groups need help with and do a bit of group practice to get comfortable with them.

After that, we'll let each group continue working on your `Book Jeff` prototypes.



## Homework

### SQL

(I assigned this before, and then decided to delay it. If you already did this, you're in luck!)

Go through the videos on [https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_basic_sql](https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_basic_sql). We'll start next class with a reading quiz about SQL.

### Keep working on your `Book Jeff` pages

You probably won't finish your pages, but make as much progress as you can with your allotted 90 minutes. We'll share our progress and keep working next class.
