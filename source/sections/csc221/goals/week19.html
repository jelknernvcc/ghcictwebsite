<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Happy New Year! We're getting a bit of a late start thanks to the Winter storm,
but we're back now and ready to move forward in our study of web application
development with Django.
</p><p style="color: red;">
But before we do that, please visit
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and use your VCCS email
address as you login and your 7-digit NOVA ID as your password to complete
your course evaluation. NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Watch Dr. Chuck's 7 minute video lecture, <i>Model View Controller in
Django</i> in <i>Lesson 9: Understanding Model View Controller (MVC)</i>.</li>

<li>Read Christopher Yong's blog post <a href="resources/MVCinDjango.pdf">MVC
pattern in Django</a>.</li>

<li style="color: red;">Prepare a one 8 1/2 by 11 inch page of notes (front and
back), which you could use on any quiz that might happen at the beginning of
class on Tuesday. NOTE: BE SURE TO HAVE YOUR SHEET OF PAPER WITH YOU WHEN
YOU COME TO CLASS!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Wednesday, January 15th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with the promised quiz based on the study questions
from your last homework. There are 14 possible points, and your grade will
be derived by taking your total points divided by 12 and then mapping that
to a letter grade using the standard A: score &gt;= 90, B: 90 &gt; score &gt;= 80 etc.).
</p><p>
After the quiz we will install and configure the
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/dj4e_samples">dj4e_samples</a>
repo that we will use to learn Django.
</p><p>
Do each of the following:
</p><ol>
<li>
Clone the
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/dj4e_samples">dj4e_samples</a> repo into
a suitable place on your development machine.
</li><li>
Add <code>.venv</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> in preperation for
setting up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtual
environment</a>. A good <code>.gitignore</code> for our purposes here should
include at least the following:
<pre>
*.swp
__pycache__
*.sqlite3
*.db
.DS_Store
*.pyc
.venv
</pre>
</li><li>
Create your virtual environment inside your project directory by running:
<pre>
% python3 -m venv .venv
</pre>
</li><li>
Activate it with:
<pre>
% source .venv/bin/activate
</pre>
</li><li>
Now install all the Django modules we will need with:
<pre>
(.venv) % pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
</li><li>
Finally, launch the Django webserver with:
<pre>
(.venv) % python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 
</pre>
and point your browser at it.
</li>
</ol><p>
At this point you should see a message in your terminal containing:
<blockquote>
You have 61 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until
you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, autos, bookmany, bookone,
cats, chat, contenttypes, favs, favsql, form, forums, gview, many, myarts,
pics, rest, sessions, social_django, taggit, tagme, tracks, users, well.  Run
'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
</blockquote>
After you last homework, you should know what this is about!
</p><p>
With the time remaining in our short class today, we will begin looking at
what this application offers us and discuss what we will do with our
homework time.
</p>

<h3>Homework - CRUD</h3>
<div>

<p>
Now that we've got Django installed - we can CRUD! For this activity, we want to get comfortable interacting with our database three different ways:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Directly interacting with sqlite</li>
    <li>Via the django shell</li>
    <li>Via the Django admin interface</li>
</ol>
<p> Follow these steps to practice each of these:
</p>

<ol>
<li>First - take a look at the admin interface. After running the migrations and creating your superuser account, navigate to <code> http://0.0.0.0:8000/admin/</code>
    and login with your superuser account.

    There are a lot of tables here for you to explore, but the simplest one that we'll focus on for now is called <code>Posts</code> all the way at the bottom.

    When you click on <code>Posts</code>, use the button at the top-right to <b>Add Post</b>. Note that the "owner" field is a dropdown that is pre-populated with only one option - your admin account.
    </li>

<li> Next, explore sqlite. In a new Terminal window, run this command to open sqlite:
</br>
<code>sqlite3 db.sqlite3</code>
In the prompt that opens, run these commands to inspect the posts table:
<blockquote>
    <pre>
sqlite> .headers on
sqlite> .mode markdown
sqlite> SELECT * from well_post;
    </pre>
</blockquote>
You should be able to see your post there! If you like, practice writing simple <code>INSERT</code> and <code>DELETE</code> queries here to directly manipulate the data in this table, and refresh the admin interface to see your changes.
</li>

<li>
    In a third terminal window, start the Django shell with this command: <code>python3 manage.py shell</code>

    From there, practice creating and saving posts, like this:
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
>>> from well.models import Post
>>> p = Post(title="asf",text="asf",owner_id=1)
>>> p.save()
        </pre>
    </blockquote>
    (1 is the id of your superuser account)
    Then compare with the sqlite interface and the admin interface to see your new post.
</li>

<li>
    Blow it all up and start over! Run this command at the terminal:
    <code>rm db.sqlite3</code>
    Then re-run the migrations, re-create your superuser, and do it all again!
    Practice this a few times until you're sure you're comfortable with each of these steps.
</li>

<h2>Monday, January 13th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p style="color: red;">
6 of the 9 of you have completed your NVCC course evaluation. The 3 of you who
have yet to do this should do it now at the beginning of class.
</p><p>
Today we will begin looking at the <q>big picture</q> of the Django
web appliation framework:
</p><p>
<img src="resources/DJ4E_BigPicture.png" alt="DJ4E Big Picture">
</p><p>
using Dr. Chuck's
<a href="https://github.com/csev/mini_django">mini_django</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Find a nice location to clone <code>mini_django</code>, and run:
<pre>
% git clone https://github.com/csev/mini_django/
</pre>
</li><li>
Start the server with:
<pre>
% python runserver.py
</pre>
</li><li>
Point your browser at your server address on port <code>9000</code>.
</li><li>
Explore the different urls suggested, watching what happens with your
web developer tools.
</li><li>
You're also going to want a copy of the <code>dj4e_examples</code> repo that
Dr. Chuck references in the homework videos. Again, you can grab our slightly
tweaked version by running:
<pre>
% git clone https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/gctaa_dj4e_samples.git
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Watch the 
<i>Django Data Models</i> video from
<a href="https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_modules">Lesson 8: Django
Data Models</a>, taking notes in a markdown file in your git repo.
</p><p style="color: red;">
You will have a quiz at the beginning of class on Wednesday. You can use
one 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheet of paper, front and back, for notes that you can
use during the quiz.
</p><p>
As you watch the videos, prepare to answer the following questions (
<i>answers to these would be the best thing to put in your notes - hint, hint!
</i>):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Chuck makes a statement about the <q>learning curve</q> for SQL.
What <i>exactly</i> does he say?</li>

<li>In your own words, how would you define <i>Object-relational mapping</i>
(ORM)?  How will we use it in Django and what specifically will it do?</li>

<li>What does Dr. Chuck say are the advantages of the ORM?  What disadvantages
(if any) does it have?</li>

<li>Dr. Chucks that <i>most</i> (he mentions a percentage) of the things you
want to do with SQL can be done effectively with an ORM. What <i>exactly</i>
does he say?</li>

<li>What is the name of the file in which the ORM data objects are defined?</li>

<li>In the example of an ORM object:
<pre>
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    email = models.CharField(max_length=128)
</pre>
Dr. Chuck draws a line to <code>models.Model</code> and mentions what that is.
What does he say? Of which 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>
feature is this an example?</li>

<li>What two commands do you need to run to go from an ORM to deployment in
a database?</li>

<li>What does running <code>python3 manage.py shell</code> do? <i>Be
specific!</i></li>

<li>In the example session Dr. Chuck talks about, he creates a new user named
Kristen with email address kf@umich.edu. Where is this user created when:
<pre>
u = User(name='Kristen', email='kf@umich.edu')
</pre>
is run? What command needs to be used to add this new user to the database?</li>
