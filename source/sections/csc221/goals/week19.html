<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Happy New Year! We're getting a bit of a late start thanks to the Winter storm,
but we're back now and ready to move forward in our study of web application
development with Django.
</p><p style="color: red;">
But before we do that, please visit
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and use your VCCS email
address as you login and your 7-digit NOVA ID as your password to complete
your course evaluation. NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with the promised quiz based on the study questions
from your last homework. There are 14 possible points, and your grade will
be derived by taking your total points divided by 12 and then mapping that
to a letter grade using the standard A: score &gt;= 90, B: 90 &gt; score &gt;= 80 etc.).
</p><p>
After the quiz we will install and configure the
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/dj4e_samples">dj4e_samples</a>
repo that we will use to learn Django.
</p><p>
Do each of the following:
</p><ol>
<li>
Clone the
<a href="https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/dj4e_samples">dj4e_samples</a> repo into
a suitable place on your development machine.
</li><li>
Add <code>.venv</code> to your <code>.gitignore</code> in preperation for
setting up a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">virtual
environment</a>. A good <code>.gitignore</code> for our purposes here should
include at least the following:
<pre>
*.swp
__pycache__
*.sqlite3
*.db
.DS_Store
*.pyc
.venv
</pre>
</li><li>
Create your virtual environment inside your project directory by running:
<pre>
% python3 -m venv .venv
</pre>
</li><li>
Activate it with:
<pre>
% source .venv/bin/activate
</pre>
</li><li>
Now install all the Django modules we will need with:
<pre>
(.venv) % pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
</li><li>
Finally, launch the Django webserver with:
<pre>
(.venv) % python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 
</pre>
and point your browser at it.
</li>
</ol><p>
At this point you should see a message in your terminal containing:
<blockquote>
You have 61 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until
you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, autos, bookmany, bookone,
cats, chat, contenttypes, favs, favsql, form, forums, gview, many, myarts,
pics, rest, sessions, social_django, taggit, tagme, tracks, users, well.  Run
'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.
</blockquote>
After you last homework, you should know what this is about!
</p><p>
With the time remaining in our short class today, we will begin looking at
what this application offers us and discuss what we will do with our
homework time.

<h2>Monday, January 13th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p style="color: red;">
6 of the 9 of you have completed your NVCC course evaluation. The 3 of you who
have yet to do this should do it now at the beginning of class.
</p><p>
Today we will begin looking at the <q>big picture</q> of the Django
web appliation framework:
</p><p>
<img src="resources/DJ4E_BigPicture.png" alt="DJ4E Big Picture">
</p><p>
using Dr. Chuck's
<a href="https://github.com/csev/mini_django">mini_django</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Find a nice location to clone <code>mini_django</code>, and run:
<pre>
% git clone https://github.com/csev/mini_django/
</pre>
</li><li>
Start the server with:
<pre>
% python runserver.py
</pre>
</li><li>
Point your browser at your server address on port <code>9000</code>.
</li><li>
Explore the different urls suggested, watching what happens with your
web developer tools.
</li><li>
You're also going to want a copy of the <code>dj4e_examples</code> repo that
Dr. Chuck references in the homework videos. Again, you can grab our slightly
tweaked version by running:
<pre>
% git clone https://git.gctaa.net/ACCICT/gctaa_dj4e_samples.git
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Watch the 
<i>Django Data Models</i> video from
<a href="https://www.dj4e.com/lessons/dj4e_modules">Lesson 8: Django
Data Models</a>, taking notes in a markdown file in your git repo.
</p><p style="color: red;">
You will have a quiz at the beginning of class on Wednesday. You can use
one 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheet of paper, front and back, for notes that you can
use during the quiz.
</p><p>
As you watch the videos, prepare to answer the following questions (
<i>answers to these would be the best thing to put in your notes - hint, hint!
</i>):
</p>
<ol>
<li>Dr. Chuck makes a statement about the <q>learning curve</q> for SQL.
What <i>exactly</i> does he say?</li>

<li>In your own words, how would you define <i>Object-relational mapping</i>
(ORM)?  How will we use it in Django and what specifically will it do?</li>

<li>What does Dr. Chuck say are the advantages of the ORM?  What disadvantages
(if any) does it have?</li>

<li>Dr. Chucks that <i>most</i> (he mentions a percentage) of the things you
want to do with SQL can be done effectively with an ORM. What <i>exactly</i>
does he say?</li>

<li>What is the name of the file in which the ORM data objects are defined?</li>

<li>In the example of an ORM object:
<pre>
class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=128)
    email = models.CharField(max_length=128)
</pre>
Dr. Chuck draws a line to <code>models.Model</code> and mentions what that is.
What does he say? Of which 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">OOP</a>
feature is this an example?</li>

<li>What two commands do you need to run to go from an ORM to deployment in
a database?</li>

<li>What does running <code>python3 manage.py shell</code> do? <i>Be
specific!</i></li>

<li>In the example session Dr. Chuck talks about, he creates a new user named
Kristen with email address kf@umich.edu. Where is this user created when:
<pre>
u = User(name='Kristen', email='kf@umich.edu')
</pre>
is run? What command needs to be used to add this new user to the database?</li>
</ol>
