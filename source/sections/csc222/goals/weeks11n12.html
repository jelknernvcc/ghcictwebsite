<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to 2nd quarter! Since we only meet once during the first week, we will
combine weeks 11 and 12 in this first evaluation period of the quarter.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today we will see a few more presentations of doctested objects. Akshay and
Jackson are ready to roll with their revised, working <i>Melting Snowman</i>
program.
</p><p>
I want to add one more requirement for an <q>A</q> evaluation of this
assignment. The project must have:
</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>A header comment that includes the authors of the program, the date
completed, and the course for which it was created. You can see an example
of this 
<a href="https://github.com/jejemplo/csc222/tree/main/DocTestedObjects/Uno">
here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> Jos√© Ejemplo will be shamelessly <q>stealing</q>, projects from
presenters for use in the future, but always with proper attribution. I
highly encourage you to do likewise. Experimenting with several examples like
this is one of the best way to learn C++.
</blockquote>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete exercises 4, 5, and 6 from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch14/ch14s01.html">
Chapter 14: Exercise Set 1</a>.
</p><p>
Be sure to commit all your work to your git repo. I'll be looking for a commit
history that shows evidence of the process you use to develop solutions to
these problems.

<h2>Wednesday, November 15th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
As we discussed in class on Monday, we will let the computer choose the
pairs that will begin presenting their object projects today. We will see
the first four projects.
</p><p>
To earn an <q>A</q> for this project, you must have each of the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>An object (a struct probably, but could be a class) that has one or
more constructors and a <code>to_string</code> member function allowing us
to <q>see</q> the object.</li>

<li><code>YourObject.h</code> and <code>YourObject.cpp</code> files, with the
former containing member function prototypes and the later containing
member function definitions.</li>

<li>A <code>test_yourobject.cpp</code> file that includes
<code>doctest.h</code> and uses a <code>TEST_CASE</code> to instantiate your
object and test its <code>to_string</code> member function.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete exercises 1, 2, and 3 from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch14/ch14s01.html">
Chapter 14: Exercise Set 1</a>.
</p><p>
Be sure to commit all your work to your git repo. I'll be looking for a commit

these problems.

<h2>Monday, November 13th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I'll start today by briefly share a little adventure I had with
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc222/-/blob/master/C++/pointerplay/chat_gpts_simple_example.c">ChatGPT</a>, and talk about how you should use this
valuable resource in your study of C++.
</p><p>
You will then have the entire rest of the class period and homework time to
work with your partner to complete the <i>Have a Little Class!</i> project
assigned <a href="week10.html">last week</a>.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, November 8th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We spent the class period on the very important task of working with
Ms. Magro to declare your major with NVCC. As I mentioned as the end of class,
I'll simply move what I had planned for today to next Monday, so you will
have some extra time to finish your <i>Have a Little Class!</i> project.
