<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>
This week we will take time to reinforce and deepen our understanding of
how to create objects in C++.
</p><p style="color: red;">
<b>UPDATE:</b> The next CPE practice session will be Saturday, December 14,
between 11 am and 5 pm. <i>The planned Saturday, December 7 session has been
cancelled!</i>

<h2>Project: Have a Little Class!</h2>
<div>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
The learning objectives of this project are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>to gain practice separating C++ objects into their three parts: header
file, source file, and testing program.</li>

<li>to practice with the use of
<a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a> for the last of
these parts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>Meet your new partner.
    
This is a paired project, and the psuedorandomly selected pairs for it are for
<b>1B</b>: Noah and Eleanor, Conrad and Alex, Gabriel and Dylan, Jake and 
Donovan, Alessandra and Toby, Grant and Udval, Evan and Zach, Fatima and Sean,
Nikita and Rockwell, with poor Luis having to work alone. For <b>4B</b> we
have: Rohoboth and Alex, Blu and Gabe, Abi and Jack, Yuri and Anupama, and
Colin and Hisham.</li>

<li>Come up with an idea for an object you could implement in C++. Think of
the two objects we've met thus far: <code>Point</code> and <code>Time</code>.
Keep your object simple for this project.</li>

<li>Assuming your object is <code>MyObject</code>, create three files:
<code>MyObject.h</code>, <code>MyObject.cpp</code>, and
<code>test_myobject.cpp</code>.  The first of these will hold your object
definition and member function prototypes, and the second the member function
definitions.</li>

<li>
<p>In the third file, start out with this:</p>
<pre>
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include &lt;doctest.h&gt;
#include "MyObject.h"
using namespace std;

TEST_CASE("Test can create and render MyObject") {
    MyObject myobj();
    CHECK(myobj.to_string() == "This is MyObject");
}
</pre>
<p>Fill in the header and source files so that this first test passes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
To help stimulate your thinking,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/DocTestedObjects">
here</a> are the OO projects from last year.
</p><p>
I leave it open ended where you take it from here. Keeping the learning goals
in mind, add more tests and then more features to your object.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This project is due by 11:59 pm on Saturday, December 7th so that I can have
the day on Sunday to evaluate your work.
