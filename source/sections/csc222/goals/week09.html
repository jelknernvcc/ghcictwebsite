<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week it's all about getting ready for the CPE!  Six of you have signed
up to test on Monday.  A few others expressed interest in testing later in
the week.  We'll have another practice test for those needing to practice
more before sitting for the certification.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>

<p>
After discussion in class on Monday, I decided that focusing on the OpenEDG
curriculum will be more beneficial for those of you preparing for the CPE
certification than another in class practice test would be, so I won't give
the one I was planning to give.
</p><p>
Instead, those of you not taking the CPE today should continue with serious,
focused preparation for it.
</p><p>
For those of you who have earned your CPE certification, I have a programming
assignment for you.
</p>
<blockquote>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of integers on the
command line, with each integer seperated by a space. Your program should
then print out the numbers entered forwards and backwards.
</blockquote>
<p>
Here is a sample run of the program:
</p>
<pre style="margin-left: 3vw;">
Enter a sequence of numbers, separated by spaces and terminated with Enter:
1 11 42 8 2 29 12 7

Your numbers were:
1 11 42 8 2 29 12 7

Your numbers backwards are:
7 12 29 2 8 42 11 1

Six of your classmates will be taking the CPE certification exam today. Let's
see how they do and what they say before I give you another 14 question
evaluation on Wednesday.
