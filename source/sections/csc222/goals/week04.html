<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will be introduced the
<a href="https://edube.org/study/cppe1">OpenEDG C++ Essentials 1</a> course,
which you will use as a resource to prepare for the
<a href="https://cppinstitute.org/cpe">CPE - C++ Certified Entry-Level
Programmer</a> certification. We will also setup a
<a href="resources/dot_vimrc.txt" download=".vimrc">.vimrc</a> file you can
use to turn vim into a light weight C++
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">
IDE</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
After getting some help from students in the afternoon section on Tuesday,
we figured out what to do about the <code>.vimrc</code> file I shared last
class not working.  It turns out that the <code>iTerm</code> terminal
emulator on your Macs does not support using <code>shift+[function key]</code>.
</p><p>
Two solutions can get around this:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> and use that as your
terminal emulator instead.</li>

<li>Remove the <q>S-</q> at the beginning of each key binding, so you use
the function key without the shift.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'll make a brief presentation highlighting the control structures presented
in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch06.html">Chapter 6:
Iteration</a> and drawing your attention to a few things that have been added
to
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch04.html">Chapter 4:
Conditionals and recursion</a> since last we visited that chapter.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete all exercises in
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch06/ch06s01.html">
Chapter 6 Exercise Set 1: CPE Practice</a>, and look at the new exercises
that have been added since we last visited
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch04/ch04s01.html">
Chapter 4 Exercise Set 1: CPE Practice</a>.
</p><p>
All of these are <q>fair game</q> for the quiz you will have at the beginning
of class next Monday.

We'll begin class by discussing any question you have from

Chapter 5 Exercise Set 1: CPE Practice</a>. We will then take a quiz based on
these exercises.
</p><p>
After that I'll show you how to use 
<a href="resources/dot_vimrc.txt" download=".vimrc">.vimrc</a> to turn vim
into a nice lightweight C++ IDE, and then let you get started on your homework
assignment.
