<h3>Classwork</h3>

There was a huge disparity in the chapter 6 quiz results between our two
periods, so we should reflect a little on while that might be so.

Period 1B will get back their quizzes today (period 4B got them back Monday),
and we will use class time to go over them.  As promised, I will have an
optional retake for the chapter 6 quiz on the back of the chapter 7 quiz on
Friday.
