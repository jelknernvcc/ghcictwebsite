There was a huge disparity in the chapter 6 quiz results between our two
periods, so we should reflect a little on while that might be so.

Period 1B will get back their quizzes today (period 4B got them back Monday),

optional retake for the chapter 6 quiz on the back of the chapter 7 quiz on
Friday.
