<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Happy New Year! We'll begin the new year picking up right where we left off at
the end of the old year, developing our <code>Card</code> objects and making
our first <q>game</q> with them.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
As I briefly discussed in our last class way back in 2024, we are going to
learn to use another development tool,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</a>.
</p><p>
I continued my search for the right learning resource for this powerful yet
complex tool, and I think I found it:
<a href="https://makefiletutorial.com/">Learn Makefiles With the tastiest
examples</a>.
</p><p>
We will use today's classwork and homework time to work through this
tutorial.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a subdirectory in your git repo named <code>LearnMake</code>. Each time
you finish one of the examples in the tutorial, make a commit so that your
versions of <code>Makefile</code> are saved in your commit history.
</p><p>
A series of commits both during and between now and next class are expected
for you to earn an A for this task.
