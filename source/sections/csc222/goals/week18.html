<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Happy New Year! We'll begin the new year picking up right where we left off at
the end of the old year, developing our <code>Card</code> objects and making
our first <q>game</q> with them. But first, we'll learn a new skill - using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> to ease the
task of compiling our software.
</p><p style="color: red;">
A big <i>thank you</i> to eveyone who completed the
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">course evaluation</a>! 16 of the 20 of you in
period 1B (80%) and 10 of 11 of you in period 4B (91%) have done this. If you
are one of the few remaining stragglers, please take a few minutes to do this
now.

<h2>Friday, January 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I used the snow day to catch up with evaluating your work. Grades for the
last assignment were 16 A's, 1 B, and 3 E's in period 1B, and 8 A's, 1 B, 1 C,
and 1 E in period 4B. While I would of course love to see fewer E's (those are
folks who didn't submit anything), I was in general very pleased with the level
of programming skills evident in your repos.
</p><p>
As I briefly discussed in our last class way back in 2024, we are going to
learn to use another development tool,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a>.
</p><p>
I continued my search for the right learning resource for this powerful yet
complex tool, and I think I found it:
<a href="https://makefiletutorial.com/">Learn Makefiles With the tastiest
examples</a>.
</p><p>
We will use today's classwork and homework time to work through this
tutorial.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a subdirectory in your git repo named <code>LearnMake</code>. Each time
you finish one of the examples in the tutorial, make a commit so that your
versions of <code>Makefile</code> are saved in your commit history.
</p><p>
A series of commits both during and between now and next class are expected
for you to earn an A for this task. You can take a peak at what our friend
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/LearnMake">Jos√©
Ejemplo</a> did to get inspiration.
</p><p>
At the beginning of class on Friday I will guide you through setting up
Make for our TDD development process.
