<p>
With our develop environment in place, this week we dive right in to learning

<h3>Shout Out</h3>
<div>
<p>
Our goal is to foster a vibrant learning community, since the best way for all
of us to learn is to learn from each other.  In that spirit, I will frequently
add a <i>Shout Outs</i> section where I will highlight particularly examples of
work done in class.
</p><p>
This week's shout out goes to Luis, who sent me the best solution to the
exercise at the end of chapter 1:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Bad syntax &amp; good semantics:</b> ..hello!My?NaMe&lt;is&#124;Luis;
  </li>
  <li><b>Bad semantics &amp; good syntax:</b> The chair was shouting silently.
  </li>
