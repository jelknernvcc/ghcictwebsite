<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to
<a href="https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=11&coid=23558">CSC 222: Object Oriented Programming</a>!
This is the 2nd in the three course core sequence in computer science at NVCC,
following
<a href="https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=11&coid=23557">CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming</a> and proceeding
<a href="https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=11&coid=23559">CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms</a>.
This is the first half of a dual-enrolled course high school course that is
paired with
<a href="https://catalog.nvcc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=11&coid=24672">CSC 208: Introduction to Discrete Structures</a> during the Spring.
</p><p>
In this course we will learn to write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>
programs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. This week
we will dive right into that task, but our first goal is to make sure everyone
has the required
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>
skills to write, compile, and run C++ programs.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Wednesday, August 30th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Please create a git repostitory named <code>csc222</code> that you will use for
the work you do for this class. You will be asked to email me a link to this
repo in this evening's homework.
</p>
<p>
After you create your repos, we will write, compile and run what is perhaps the
most famous program in the world, <code>hello_world.cc</code>.
</p><p>
The source code for our take today on this classic little gem is:
</p>
<pre class="sourcecode">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// main: generate some simple output

int main()
{
    int num = 42;

    cout &lt;&lt; "The answer to the ultimate question of life, ";
    cout &lt;&lt; "the universe and everything is (of course) ";
    cout &lt;&lt; num  &lt;&lt; "." &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The reason this silly little program is so famous is that if you can compile
it and run it, it means you have a working development environment and you
know how to use it. That is no small feat.
</p><p>
While I won't prevent you from using any other development tools you like,
the only tools I will be using in class, and the only ones you can ask me for
help with, are the Unix CLI, the Vim text editor, and the command-line C++
compiler on your system.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
<i>Using your VCCS email account</i>, send me an email to my VCCS email
address: <code>jde232@email.vccs.edu</code> introducing yourself to me by
answering the following questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your past experience with with the Unix CLI, console based text
editors like Vim, and revision control using git?
</li>

<li>What is your previous programming experience? Which programming languages
do you know?  How well do you feel you know them? With which programming
environments do you have experience?
</li>

<li>What motivated you to sign up for this course, and what are you hoping
to get out of it? Please be as specific as you can. I have some flexibility in
the particulars of what we do in this course, so the better I understand what
you're looking for, the better I can modify our plans to better align them with
your goals.</li>

<li>Read
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch01.html">Chapter 1: The way
of the program</a> in our text and send me a solution to the two exercises at
the end of the chapter.</li>

<li>What is the URL of your <code>csc222</code> git repo that you will use for
this class?</li>

<li>Is there anything you would like to see in a <i>Classroom Charter</i> 
containing the rules and norms we all agree together to abide in our learning
community?</li>

<li>Is there anything else you would like me to know about you?</li>
</ol>

<p style="color: red;">
<b>NOTE:</b> Please submit this assignment by 11:59 pm on Sunday at the
latest, so that I have time Monday to reply to your email before our next
class on Tuesday.
</p>

You will earn an A for this first assignment if you provide thoughful answers
to my 7 questions, a B if you provide some answer to each question, a C if you
answer some of the questions, a D send me an email, and an E if you do not.
