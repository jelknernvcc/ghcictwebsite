<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>
With only 2 1/2 weeks left in our course, it's time to do a culminating
project that will bring together, reinforce, and build on everything you have
learned this year.
</p><p>
I'll provide two choices, at the beginning of class on Tuesday, and you can
either select from these or pitch me a project idea of your own.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Once again, a big <i>thank you</i> to eveyone who completed the
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">course evaluation</a>! 18 of the 20 of you in
period 1B (90%) and 10 of 11 of you in period 4B (91%) have now done this, 
a very respectable participation rate, <i>but not yet perfect</i> ;-) If you
are one of the last of the stragglers, please take a few minutes to do this
now.

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
At the beginning of class today I want everyone to select a <i>final project</i>
that you will have the remaining 2 1/2 weeks of class to complete.
<span style="color: red;">It will be due at the end of the last day of class
on Wednesday, January 29th.</span>
</p><p>
Here are two possible projects, the first of which I will provide the most
support, and the second of which I'll be asking for students who feel more
confident with C++ who can help us continue to develop our card games building
on <a href="https://github.com/BlueZeeKing/cards">the work Brayden has been
doing</a>.
</p>

<h3>Possible Projects</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>BigInt Case Study</b>: Implement an arbitrary precision integer object
in C++.</li>

<li><b>C++ Card Game Collection</b>: Implement a card game with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses">ncurses</a> user interface.</li>

<li>A project idea of your own with permission of instructor.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We will discuss these options at the beginning of class on Tuesday, and you
will be asked to choose one and let me know which one you've chosen.
</p><p style="color: red;">
In addition to culminating <i>product evaluation</i> on January 29th, you will
be evaluated weekly on your <i>process</i> based on the commit history in your
git repo.
