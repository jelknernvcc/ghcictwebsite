<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will tack on Tuesday, November 26th to this <q>week</q>, so it will
include plans for 4 class meetings. We will use this time to complete
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch11.html">Chapter 11:
Member functions</a>, at which we finally arrive at writing our own
objects in C++.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice</h3>
I received an email from the Georgetown University neuroscience research
study some of you heard about several weeks back letting me know no one from
my classes had responded to the request for participants. So here is the
recruitment flyer again. You can still sign on, and I'll free up classtime
for participation if you are willing.

<h3>Classwork</h3>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/BlueZeeKing">Blue Zee King</a> is always
playing the tunes I want to hear, and this time was no exception. I asked
him to write a program to assign exercises to random students, and he
delivered. He did such a fine job that I just stole
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/choosers/exercises">
his code</a> (with attribution, of course!) so we could use it in class.
</p><p>
I highly recommend taking at look at this code, looking for his improvements
to the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/choosers/pairs">
pairs</a> chooser from which I asked him to derive it.
</p><p>
We will use this today to select students to present solutions to our
homework exercises.
