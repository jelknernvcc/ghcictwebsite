<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will tack on Tuesday, November 26th to this <q>week</q>, so it will
include plans for 4 class meetings. We will use this time to complete
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch11.html">Chapter 11:
Member functions</a>, at which we finally arrive at writing our own
objects in C++.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Notice</h3>
I received an email from the Georgetown University neuroscience research
study some of you heard about several weeks back letting me know no one from
my classes had responded to the request for participants. So here is the
recruitment flyer again. You can still sign on, and I'll free up classtime
for participation if you are willing.

We'll begin class by reflecting on what we can learn from our first programming
assignment. The grade distribution was: <b>A</b>: 17, <b>B</b>: 5, <b>C</b>:3,
<b>E</b>: 5. Not bad, but I would be happier still if there were even more
A's, and the main thing preventing that from happening came from students not
knowing how to do <q>the dance</q>:
</p><ol>
<li>Write a test with just enough scaffolding to make it compile (and
fail).</li>
<li><b>Commit!</b></li>
<li>Write code to make the test pass.</li>
<li><b>Commit again!</b></li>
</ol><p>
We also need to talk about how to keep unwanted things (meta data, binary files
and things that don't belong) out of your git repos.  I filed issues for many
of you when I found <code>a.out</code> files, or <code>.swp</code> files, but
I want to take a minute in class to talk more about this. Also, <i>never
put private information in a git repo!</i> I found at least one private key,
which is just such private information.
</p><p>
The <a href="https://github.com/BlueZeeKing">Blue Zee King</a> is always
playing the tunes I want to hear, and this time was no exception. I asked
him to write a program to assign exercises to random students, and he
delivered. He did such a fine job that I just stole
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/choosers/exercises">
his code</a> (with attribution, of course!) so we could use it in class.
</p><p>
I highly recommend taking at look at this code, looking for his improvements
to the
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/choosers/pairs">
pairs</a> chooser from which I asked him to derive it. I'll discuss briefly
how he has written a <i>generalization</i> of the specific problem given him
to make his code potentially more useful. This is just the kind of
<q>conversation in code</q> that I hope we will do more of.
</p><p>
We will use this today to select students to present solutions to our
homework exercises. Only students who had A evaluations will be called upon
to share their solutions.

Read <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch11.html">Chapter 11:
Member functions</a>, trying the examples yourself and commiting them to your
git repos.
