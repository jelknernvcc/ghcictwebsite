<p>
I am getting more and more excited about
<a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a>, which is just the
kind of testing tool I was hoping to find for C++, having been spoiled by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest">original doctest</a>
developed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Peters_(software_engineer)">Tim
Peters</a> for Python.
</p><p>
Today in class I will show you how to configure your local C/C++ development
environment for easy use of this wonderful resource.

<h3>Configuring <code>CPATH</code> for Local Libraries</h3>
<div>
<p>
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Environment-Variables.html">CPATH
</a> is an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment
variable</a> that specifies the <b>search path</b> that the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor">preprocessor</a> uses
for to look for <code>somelibrary.h</code> in a
<code>#include &lt;somelibrary.h&gt;</code>
<a href="https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/">directive</a>.
</p><p>
To set our <code>CPATH</code>, we need to: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>create a directory where C/C++ libraries will be stored.</li>
  <li>set the <code>CPATH</code> environment variable to the path to that
  directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>
On my GNU/Linux box, I did this by:
</p>
<ol>
<li>running:
<pre>
$ mkdir -p ~/.local/lib/gcc/include
</pre>
</li>
<li>add adding the line:
<pre>
export CPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/gcc/include/
</pre>
to my <code>.bashrc</code> file (<i>Note:</i> You MacOS users will have to
add this to <code>.zshrc</code> instead).
</ol>
<p>
After copying
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doctest/doctest/master/doctest/doctest.h">doctest.h</a> to <code>~/.local/lib/gcc/include</code>, I can now just
add:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;doctest.h&gt;
</pre>
<p>
to any program in which I want to use doctest.

<h3>Project: Have a Little Class!</h3>
<div>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
The learning objectives of this project are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>to gain practice separating C++ objects into their three parts: header
file, source file, and testing program.</li>

<li>to introduce you to the use of
<a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a> for the last of
these parts.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Process</h4>
<ol>
<li>Meet your new partner. This is a paired project, and the psuedorandomly
selected pairs for it are: </li>

<li>Come up with an idea for an object you could implement in C++. Think of
the objects we've met thus far: <code>Point</code>, <code>Time</code>,
<code>Card</code>, and <code>Fraction</code>, and use them for inspiration if
nothing comes to you at first.  Keep your object simple for this project.</li>

<li>Assuming your object is <code>MyObject</code>, create three files:
<code>MyObject.h</code>, <code>MyObject.cpp</code>, and
<code>test_myobject.cpp</code>.  The first of these will hold your object
definition and member function prototypes, and the second the member function
definitions.</li>

<li>
<p>In the third file, start out with this:</p>
<pre>
#define DOCTEST_CONFIG_IMPLEMENT_WITH_MAIN
#include &lt;doctest.h&gt;
#include "MyObject.h"
using namespace std;

TEST_CASE("Test can create and render MyObject") {
    MyObject myobj();
    CHECK(myobj.to_string() == "This is MyObject");
}
</pre>
<p>Fill in the header and source files so that this first test passes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
