<h1>CSC 222 Final Project Grading Rubric</h1>

<table>
<tr>
  <th>Grade</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>A</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is presented that compiles and runs on an APS issued
  student laptop (and hopefully on other
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> compliant systems
  like my GNU/Linux workstation) using
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>.  
  The program delivers what was promised in the project proposal. Documentation
  provided with the program is sufficient to guide installation and
  configuration of any 3rd party C++ libraries used, and the documentation is
  provided with the source code using
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> files. Both
  source code and documentation are located together in a clearly structured,
  easy to navigate
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> repository.
  Unit tests using <a href="https://github.com/doctest/doctest">doctest</a>
  are included that test all of the core functions of the code, and all tests
  pass when run. Finally, the program involves the use of the object-oriented
  programming features studied in our course, and aligns with the learning
  objectives expressed by the developer in their project proposal.

  <th>B</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is presented that compiles and runs on an APS issued laptop.
  It delivers most of what was promised in the project proposal, but might
  fall short of fully meeting project goals as required for an A. Documention
  allowing visitors to the projects git repository to download, compile and
  run the program mostly works, but may need a bit of web searching to get
  the program running. The program does most of what the proposal said it
  would do, and most of the core functionality is tested, and all tests pass.

  <th>C</th>
  <td>
  A C++ program is presented that compiles and runs on an APS issued laptop.
  It delivers at least a part of what was promised in the project proposal,
  but might fall well short of meeting project goals as required for an A or B.
  Documention is lacking or missing. The program shows some evidence of
  working toward the goal of the he project proposal. Some doctests are present
  but either many features of the program are not tested or some of the tests
  don't pass.

<tr>
  <th>D</th>
  <td>
  Some work was completed, but it shows only minimal effort and does not
  provide sufficient evidence of goal attainment or learning mastery.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>E</th>
  <td>
  No evidence of work presented.
