<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Our class as a whole was stumped by Lab 6.2, so I thought this a good time
to revisit our Java development environment lite and to encourage you to
review the <b>String methods</b> you learned here:
</p>
<p class="stringmethods">
<img src="JavaStringMethods.png" alt="String methods">
</p>
<p>
Strings are important things.  I strongly recommend you become very familiar
with these string methods and learn how to use them well. Lab 6.2 is aimed at
getting you to do this very thing.
</p>


<h2>Activity 6.2</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
A trial web site is developed on which passengers may specify their meal
preferences prior to flying. They do so by entering a phrase that is converted
to lower case and then stored in a String variable, request. Write code that
stores in the int mealcode the value corresponding to the first of the
following conditions that applies:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Meal Code</th>
  <th>Condition</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>request contains either "no beef" or "chicken" but not the word "child"
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>request contains the word "beef" but not the word "child"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>request contains the word "vegetarian"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td>
  <td>request contains the word "child" but not the word "vegetarian"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>if none of the above conditions is met</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
Here is a runnable solution to this problem:
</p>
<pre class="solution">
public class Act6_2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String request = "child lo mein";
        int mealcode;

        if (request.indexOf("no beef") != -1 ||
            request.indexOf("chicken") != -1 &amp;&amp;
            request.indexOf("child") == -1)
        {
            mealcode = 1;
        }
        else if (request.indexOf("beef") != -1 &amp;&amp;
                 request.indexOf("child") == -1)
        {
            mealcode = 2;
        }
        else if (request.indexOf("vegetarian") != -1)
        {
            mealcode = 3;
        }
        else if (request.indexOf("child") != -1 &amp;&amp;
                 request.indexOf("vegetarian") == -1)
        {
            mealcode = 4;
        }
        else
        {
            mealcode = 0;
        }

        System.out.println(mealcode);
    }
}
</pre>


<h2>Activity 6.3</h2>

<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>
An array meals contains five elements corresponding to the meal codes 0 through
4 in Activity 6.2. For example, element <code>meals[1]</code> contains the
number of <q>Chicken-based adult</q> meals requested, <code>meals[4]</code>
contains the number of <q>Burger child</q> meals, and so on. Element
<code>meals[0]</code> contains the number of requests in which none of the
conditions for a particular meal type was met.
</p>
<p>
Write code to store in the double cost the cost to the airline of providing the
meals, where the cost for a meal of each type is specified in the table below.
The number of meals in <code>meals[0]</code> should be split equally between
<q>Chicken-based adult</q> and <q>Beef-based adult</q>. If this number is not
an even number, then the number allocated to <q>Chicken-based adult</q> should
be one more than the number allocated to <q>Beef-based adult</q>.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Meal Code</th><th>Meal Cost</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td><td>$1.75</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td><td>$2.08</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td><td>$2.14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>4</td><td>$0.98</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
Here is a runnable solution to this problem:
</p>
<pre class="solution">
public class Act6_3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int meals[] = {0, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        double cost;

        if (meals[0] % 2 == 0)
        {
            cost = meals[0] * (1.75 + 2.08) / 2; 
        }
        else
        {
            cost = (meals[0] / 2 + 1) * 1.75 + (meals[0] / 2) * 2.08;      
        }
        cost += meals[1]*1.75 + meals[2]*2.08 + meals[3]*2.14 + meals[4]*0.98;

        System.out.println(cost);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Much like in the study of mathematics, learning computer science is a
<i>cumulative process</i>. As long as you have a solid understanding of each
new concept you learn, it doesn't really become more difficult.  Once you allow
large holes to develop in your understanding however, the whole learning
process quickly grinds to a halt. My impression is that you all had a hole in
your understanding of <b>String methods</b>, which explains your trouble with
exercise 6.2.
