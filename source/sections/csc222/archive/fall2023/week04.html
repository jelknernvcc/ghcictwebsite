<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week slow down and begin to dig deeper into what we have learned so far
this year.  With the introduction of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_string_handling">strings</a>,
we will now have both the data types (to handle numbers and text) and the
control structures needed for writing programs to solve a wide range of
interesting problems.
</p>

<h2>Thursday, September 21st</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today by looking at Jos√© Ejemplo's solutions to the
homework exercises.  We'll then talk about how to use Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)">
I/O redirection</a> to read and write data in files. 
</p><p>
Finally, we will choose pairs for a project assignment (*NOTE*: pairs choosen
were: Johan and Fikir, Ivan and Adonis, Ved and Cody, Anar and Anfal, Shangwen
and Turner, Isaac and Luis, Trostin and Caleb, Parker and Dane, Akshay and Mr.
Curtis, James and Liam, and Jamethiel and Marin).
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Find a problem from a <i>High School Programming contest</i> that can be
solved with the programming tools we have thus far (most problems should
now fit into this category). Work with your partner to develop a solution
to your problem that you can present in class next week.
</p><p>
An example of a set of such a problems is
<a href="https://www.seminolestate.edu/computers/competition/samples/2016">
this set</a> from <a href="https://www.seminolestate.edu/">Seminole State
University</a>.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
I was very impressed with the work I saw in your git repos this past weekend.
It seems everyone was able to remain on the ship as it rocketed through the
first 6 chapters of our book. This week the promised slow down begins, where
we will begin to dive deeper into how computers work, necessitated by the
complex and sordid history of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string</a>
handling in C++.
</p><p>
I modified <a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/">our text</a>
yesterday to move all the end of chapter exercises into seperate files for
chapters 1 to 7 in anticipation of the work we are about to begin on
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch07.html">Chapter 7: Strings
and things</a>.
</p><p>
Some things we need to discuss:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is a <b>string</b>?</li>
  <li>What is a <b>character</b>?</li>
  <li>What is a <b>character set</b>?</li>
  <li>What is <b>ASCII</b>? What is <b>EBCDIC</>? What is <b>Unicode</b>?</li>
  <li>How are strings handled in C++?</li>
  <li>Yuck, why so many different and incompatible ways?</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Work with your partner on the projects we discussed in class.
