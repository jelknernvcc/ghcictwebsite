<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will be diving deeper into the OOP features of C++.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, October 26th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today we will discuss the key ideas from
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/ch13.html">Chapter 13: Vectors
of objects</a>, including the <code>to_string()</code> member function and
C++'s support for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading">operator
overloading</a>.
</p><p>
<i>Shout out to Caleb for being on top of this!</i>  He came across issues
compiling the <code>Card</code> class that he and I discovered resulted from
his school MacBook beging configured to use an older version of the C++
standard.  Our book is using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11">C++11</a>. It turns out a
command-line option can fix the problem, but we should investigate setting up
a default configuration on your machines so that you don't have to use it.

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>
Continue working on the <code>Fraction</code> class, using what you were shown
today in class.
