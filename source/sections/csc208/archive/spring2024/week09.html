<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will finish
<a href="https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/ch_sequences.html">Chapter 2:
Sequences</a> and prepare for a test on the chapter on Monday, April 8th. 
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, April 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will use class time to work on exercises from <i>Section 2.5: Induction</i> 
and <i>Section 2.6: Chapter Summary</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Study for the chapter 2 test on Monday. The test will consist of 5 or 6
problems from each section of the chapter.
</p><p>
You will be allowed to bring <i>one page</i>, printed front and back to use
as notes during the test. My recommendation would be for you to include
the things that appear in blue boxes in the online version of our text.
You can look at
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch2_sequences">my
notes</a> too, since I have versions of all of those in Markdown and LaTeX
that you can copy and paste.
