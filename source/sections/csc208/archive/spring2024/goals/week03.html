<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week will complete 
<i>Chapter 0: Introduction and Preliminaries</i>, and have a test based on
the exercises in the chapter on Friday.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, February 16th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Adonis will summarize our homework reading, and we will discuss the kinds
of practice we need to do to convince ourselves we have a working understand
of the topics presented.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete the practice exercises at the end of <i>Section 1.1: Additive and
Multiplicative Principles</i> on pages 67 to 69 of our textbook. Solutions to
exercises 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 are provided at the end of the
book.  If one of you (or prefereably, a pair) who have yet to present would
like to take on exercises 4 and 10, that would be delightful.
</p><p>
Create a new directory named <code>ch1_counting</code>. Create a
<code>README.md</code> file for notes on this chapter, and a
<code>sect1.1.md</code> in which to put your exercise solutions. Use this
assignment as a chance to begin learning how to markup mathematics in
Markdown files on our git host.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due on Sunday, February 18th at 11:59 pm so that I can
evaluate it on Monday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
The milage will certainly vary for how much of this assignment each of you
will be able to complete in the time allotted for it.  I understand this, and
as I have been saying throughout the year, I am looking for a commitment of
at least 90 minutes of time spent on it, with the product reflecting that
amount of time.
</p>

<h2>Wednesday, February 14th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with two presentations:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Direct Proof</b>: Caleb</li>
<li><b>How to Organize Our Study</b>: Trostin</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depending on the outcome of the discussion introduced by Trostin, we will
assign homework.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Section 1.1: Additive and Multiplicative Principles</i> from
<i>Chapter 1: Counting</i> (pages 57 to 69).  Take notes in a Markdown file
named <code>Counting.md</code> in your git repo. The presence of these notes
will be the accountability piece we talked about in class today, and you will
be credited (or not) by its presence.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Monday, February 12th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class today with two presentations on using the computer
programming languages we know as tools to help us understand discrete math:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sets in Python</b>: Liam and Isaac</li>
<li><b>Computing Truth Tables</b>: Luis (Python) and Akshay (C++)</li>
</ul>
<p>
After these presentations, we will discuss how to use
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to mark up your mathematics
in Markdown files.  We'll take a look a few things
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208">Jos√© Ejemplo</a> has been doing with
this and discuss the role that sharing best practices will play in developing
our learning community.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a subdirectory in your csc208 git repo named
<code>ch0_preliminaries</code>. Use this directory to place Markdown files with
notes and resources for <i>Chapter 0: Introduction and Preliminaries</i> from
our textbook.
</p><p>
Since the original pacing I planned was <i>way off</i>, and since I need to
get some third quarter evaluation into Synergy, your first evaluation for
third quarter will be based the contents of your git repo.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due at 3 pm on Tuesday, February 13th. An <q>A</q>
evaluation will show a regular commit history of work directly related to
the chapter we are studying.
