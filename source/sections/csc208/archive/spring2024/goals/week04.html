<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We will continue our study of the counting principles presented in chapter 1
of our textbook.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, February 23rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Wow, the <b>binomial coefficients</b> section was <i>facinating!</i> I thought
Dr. Levin's presentation was fabulous as well, leading us on a story of three
very different ways to think about the same
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction">abstraction</a> (bit
strings, lattice paths, and binomial coefficients).
</p><p>
I hope some of you found this to be as much of a joyful read as I did. In any
event, following the agreed upon plan that Trostin proposed to us, our next
task is to divide up the 13 exercises at the end of the section, and find pairs
of volunteers willing to be responsible for presenting solutions to them when
we meet for class next Tuesday.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Work as many of the 13 exercises at the end of section 1.2 as your 90 minutes
allows. Exercises 8 and 13 do not have solutions, so leave these to last, but
at least read them, so that when solutions are presented in class you are
mentally ready to understand the solutions.
</p><p style="color: red;">
This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Saturday, February 24th so that I have
time on Sunday to evaluate your work.

<h2>Wednesday, February 21st</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we will discuss the practice exercises from section 1.1
assigned last class. Anfal and Ved will share a detailed solution to
exercises 4 and 10, and we will discuss any other exercise solutions that
folks in class want to discuss.
