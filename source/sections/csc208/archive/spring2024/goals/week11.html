<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class by discussing solutions to the sequence test we took
last week. I was generally very pleased with the results of that test. The
grade distribution for our class was as follows: <b>A</b>: 9, <b>B</b>: 2,
<b>C</b>: 2, <b>D</b>: 6, <b>E</b>: 2. This result indicates that the majority
of you have grasped the fundamentals of the sequence mathematics tested. 
</p><p>
We can use
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch2_sequences/SequencesTestSolutions.md">Jos√©
Ejemplo's Sequence test solutions</a> as a primary resource for going over the
test.
</p><p>
We will spend the rest of class period and our homework time working the
problems at the end of section 3.1.
