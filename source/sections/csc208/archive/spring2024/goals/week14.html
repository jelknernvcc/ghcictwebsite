<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we begin our last major topic of the course,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, May 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I'll start class by sharing how far I've gotten with the exercises in
section 4.1, and share the kind of detail I'll be looking for on our
next test.
</p><p>
Our test next Tuesday will only be on section 4.1.  We won't have time to
finish 4.2, which you will work on while I am away at Pycon.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>

<p>
It's that time again, time for <a href=" http://nova.mce.cc/">NVCC course
evaluations</a>!  Please login using your VCCS email address as your
user name and your student ID as your password.
</p><p>
The grade distribution on the last test was:
A: 12, B: 4, D:3, which overall is a better result than the previous test.
</p><p>
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch3_logic/ProofsTestSolutions.md">
Here</a> are solutions to the test. I want to draw your attention to
Caleb's solution problem 2, which was an absolute delight for me to see while
grading the tests. The
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic">
fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> is <i>such</i> an important idea. It was
great to see it used so effectively here.
</p><p>
Using class time and homework time today, we should complete all the
exercises in <i>Section 4.1: Definitions</i>. 
</p><p>
We will have our next test on this section and <i>Section 4.2: Trees</i>
next Tuesday, May 14th.

<h2>Monday, May 6th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with our <i>Chapter 3: Proofs</i> test.
</p><p>
After you finish the test, you should begin reading
<i>Section 4.1: Definitions</i> from <i>Chapter 4: Graph Theory</i>, taking
notes in your git repo. We will introduce this topic in class on Wednesday.
</p><p>
As I have done throughout this course, I went looking for a Python library that
might serve us in this study. It didn't take long to find one (this is why
I <i>love</i> Python so much! ;-), but I have not had a chance to explore it
yet. It would be wonderful if one of the bright and ambitious overachievers in
our class could do that before I do! It's called
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/graph-theory/">graph-theory</a>, and at first
glance it looks most promising.
