<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Let's aim to finish <i>Section 3.2: Proofs</i> this week, so we can test on it
during class on Monday, May 6th. 
</p>

<section>
<h2>Tuesday, April 30th and Thursday, May2nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with a discussion of the last proof technique introduced
in our text, <i>Proof by Cases</i>, and discuss how this is related to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set">partition</a> of
the problem domain set. Our friend Jos√© Ejemplo will share some investigation
he did, including
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc208/src/branch/master/ch3_logic/sect3.2notes.md">a
proof</a> he did using this approach.
</p><p>
We will also look at the <i>ChatGPT Cautionary Tale</i> below, and use to
discuss while it is a valuable resource, you need to use it with understanding
or you risk getting burned.
</p><p>
After that you will have the rest of class, and all class on Thursday, to
complete the exercises in <i>Section 3.2: Proofs</i>, an
<i>Section 3.3: Chapter Summary</i>.
</p><p>
Please remember our understanding that <i>if you can make a convincing,
git repo evidence based argument that you spent the allotted time studying
the chapter and working the exercises, you can appeal to me to earn a one
letter grade increase on your test score.</i>
</p>

<h3>Chapter 3 Test</h3>
<div>
<p>
While I haven't made the test yet, I have a pretty good idea what I will put
on it. It will include one truth table question like the ones we did in
section 3.1, with the rest being proof questions from section 3.2.

<h3>A ChatGPT Cautionary Tale</h3>
<div>
<p>
After talking with you in class last Friday about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_trichotomy">trichotomy</a> as
an example of a tool in proof by cases, I decided to ask ChatGPT for a good
example.

Here is what transpired:
