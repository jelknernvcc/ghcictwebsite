<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet twice this week and once next week, so we will combine these togeter
into <q>week 13</q>.  With hard work and a bit of good fortune, we can finish
our goal of using our I/O library to write simple interactive programs in
assembly language during this time.
</p><p>
We can then return from Thanksgiving break to start week 15, and move from
assembly language to the higher leven and thus much more <q>human friendly</q>
language C.

<h2>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h2>
<div>
<p>
Thus far, only two students have sent me working program that meet all the
requirements for this unit:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="resources/assmbly_progs1/AKSHAY.ASM" download="AKSHAY.ASM">
AKSHAY.ASM</a></li>
<li><a href="resources/assmbly_progs1/MARIN.ASM" download="MARIN.ASM">
MARIN.ASM</a></li>
<li><a href="resources/assmbly_progs1/RISACHER.ASM" download="RISACHER.ASM">
RISACHER.ASM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Today, Monday, November 25 is the last class session you will have to
complete your assembly language unit project.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Everyone other than Marin and Akshay should email me a link to their finished
program by Tuesday, November 26th at 11:59 pm.
</p><p>
I will use our
<a href="../resources/class_git_repo_rubric.html">class git repo rubric</a>
to evaluate your work. If you want an A, your repo should show clear evidence
of <i>continual engagement</i> and <i>incremental development</i> as you work
your way toward completing step 4 above.
</p><p>
In addition to the expected git repo contents listed in the rubric, to earn an
A for this project you must:
</p>
<ol>
<li>email me with a link to your completed assembly language program.</li>
<li>your program must assemble and run.</li>
<li>your program must interact with the user (using the I/O library)
and do something useful.</li>
</ol>
