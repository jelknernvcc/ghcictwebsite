<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I hope everyone had a restful Thanksgiving holiday and you've come back ready
to start programming in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>!  After
programming in binary, and then assembly langauge, I think you will
<i>greatly</i> appreciate the usability and power that a higher level
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming"> structured
programming</a> language like C gives us.
</p><p>
This will be an opportunity for those of you who struggled with the previous
project to start fresh!

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
So if you recall last Wednesday, I said my homework was to investigate that
problem I showed you with <code>EOF</code> not being found. It turns that
I had caused the problem by changing the type of the <code>ch</code> variable
I was reading from <code>int</code> to <code>char</code>. This caused the
problem because <a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/eofnotchar/">EOF is not a
character</a>! A wonderful blog post that is, by the way, and well worth a
quick reading.

<h2>Wednesday, December 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
As I started experimenting with more and more C programs, I quickly ended up with a mess of files on my <code>I</code> drive.  I wanted to just run:
</p><pre>
I&gt;era *.*
</pre><p>
to start fresh, but then I realized that this would remove all the files needed
to compile C programs.  And what if I wanted to work on drive <code>J</code> or
drive <code>D</code>?
</p><p>
My familiarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> files
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file">batch files</a>, which are
similiar (if much less powerful) to Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell scripts</a> led me
to wonder if <code>CP/M</code> had something similar. It turns out it does.
They are less powerful still than batch files (not surprisingly), but they
can help us out here. They work with the
<a href="http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch1.htm#Section_1.6.7">SUBMIT command</a>, and they use the file extention <code>.SUB</code>.
Here is the source to <code>CSTUFF.SUB</code>:
</p><pre>
PIP $1:=C:CC.COM
PIP $1:=C:CC2.COM
PIP $1:=C:CLINK.COM
PIP $1:=C:C.CCC
PIP $1:=C:DEFF.CRL
PIP $1:=C:DEFF2.CRL
PIP $1:=C:STDIO.H
</pre><p>
Copy this file to your <code>C</code> drive.  Then, if you want to use say
drive <code>J</code> for compiling C programs, you can just run:
</p><pre>
submit c:cstuff J
</pre><p>
and it will copy the 7 files you need from drive <code>C</code> to
<code>J</code>.
</p><p>
As I made my way through your repos this morning, I found the following
programs we should share today:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PB22-School/csc215/refs/heads/main/MP2/C_stuff/clisum.c">Parker and Caleb</a>,
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudegod1/csc215/refs/heads/main/CLISUM.c">
Ved and Trostin</a>,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Cody/csc215/raw/branch/main/C/clisum.c">Cody</a>
(<i>note:</i> Cody does the checking for numeric string I was hoping for),
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan-franco/csc215/refs/heads/main/Cprogams/CLISUM.C">Johan and Anar</a>,
</p><p>
Far and away the top prize for best <q>do it yourself</q> solution goes to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Jamethiel/csc215/raw/branch/main/c_code/CLISUM.C">
Jamethiel</a>. Her's is the one you should study if you want to really learn
C! My partner
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AkshayKuchibhatla/csc215/refs/heads/main/Programs/C_programs/clisum2.c">Akshay</a> has another one you should
review. Finally there is the one
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/CLISUM.C">
José Ejemplo</a> wrote before I gave you this assignment.
</p><p>
It turns out file I/O is not very difficult after all. Using <i>The Buffered
File I/O Functions</i> section on page 133 of the <i>BDS C User's Guide</i>,
José Ejemplo was able to write
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/MYCOPY.C">
MYCOPY.C</a>. We will look over this in class before you begin work on your
next assignment.
</p>

<h3>End of Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Continue working with your same partner for this iteration. Complete as many
of the following exercises as class time plus 90 minutes of homework time
allow: Exercises 1-6, 1-7 and 1-8 on page 18, and 1-9, 1-10 and 1-11 on
page 19 of <i>The C Programming Language</i>.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Your evaluation will be based on how well your git repo shows evidence of
<b>iterative development</b>. A single commit of completed work will only
earn you a D! <i>This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Thursday, December
5th</i> so that I can evaluate it before class starts on Friday.

<h2>Monday, December 2nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
The grade distribution for the assembly language programming projects was:
<b>A</b>: 8, <b>B</b>: 3, and <b>E</b>: 4. I am fully aware how challenging it
is to understand a computer at the level needed to write in assembly. Those of
you who struggled will now get some welcome relief and an opportunity for a
fresh start. Hopefully you at least gained an appreciation for the challenge.
C provides enough <i>abstraction</i> of the machine that you will be able
to write C programs without reference to the details of the hardware on which
they are running.
</p><p>
We'll start class today by setting up a new development environment for
learning C programming on CP/M using BDS C.  I've created a
<a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-and-extract-archives-using-the-tar-command-in-linux/">
tar zip</a> file containing everything you'll need, and I developed
step-by-step instructions for getting you through <code>helloworld.c</code>.
</p><p>
Read
<a href="../resources/helloworld_with_bds_c.html">Hello World with BDS C</a>
and follow the steps until you have a running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello%2C_World!%22_program">Hello,
World! program</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I ran the random pair chooser, which gave us the following programming pairs
for this first assignment:
</p><pre>
Parker and Caleb
Johan and Anar
Issac and Anfal
Luis and Cody
Jamethiel and Turner
Ved and Trostin
Marin and Adonis
Akshay and Jeff
</pre><p>
Your task is to write a program named CLISUM that takes a sequence of integer
values at the CP/M command line and prints out their sum. An A submission
should gracefully handle invalid input. Sample runs might include:
</p><pre>
I&gt;clisum 5 15 22 8
Sum is 50
I&gt;clisum 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Sum is 7
I&gt;clisum 5 15 icecream 8
OOPS! ICECREAM is not a number
</pre><p>
In addition to the <code>ARGS.C</code> program I will share with you in class,
you should use the <code>ndigit</code> discussion beginning on page 20, and the
<code>atoi</code> discussion beginning on page 39 of <i>The C Programming
Language</i> as resources.
</p><p>
<span style="color: red;">This assignment is due <i>before</i> class starts
on Wednesday!</span> Pairs will have 5 minutes to present their solutions
during the first part of class. Credit will only be earned if you have the
presented source in your repo before class starts.
<i style="color: red;">Each of you must have it in your own repo to earn
credit!</i></span>
