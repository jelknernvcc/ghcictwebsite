<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I hope everyone had a restful Thanksgiving holiday and you've come back ready
to start programming in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>!  After
programming in binary, and then assembly langauge, I think you will
<i>greatly</i> appreciate the usability and power that a higher level
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming"> structured
programming</a> language like C gives us.
</p><p>
This will be an opportunity for those of you who struggled with the previous
project to start fresh!

<h2>Friday, December 6th</h2>

<h3>Start of Class</h3>
<div>
<p>
Last Wednesday I said my homework was to investigate that problem I showed you
with <code>EOF</code> not being found. It turns out that I had caused the
problem by changing the type of the <code>ch</code> variable I was reading from
<code>int</code> to <code>char</code>. This caused the problem because
<a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/eofnotchar/">EOF is not a character</a>!
That link is to a wonderful blog post, by the way, well worth a quick reading.
</p><p>
We will discuss the problems assigned for homework, and then pair you up again
and give you time to begin working on the new classwork / homework problems.
A few programs I'd like to share include
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/MYCOPY.C">MYCOPY.C</a>,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/PNUM.C">PNUM.C</a>, 
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/UCASE.C">UCASE.C</a>, and especially 
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/WRDLINE.C">WRDLINE.C</a> and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/WC.C">WC.C</a>.
</p><p>
I'll demo the last two of these and <i>highly</i> encourage you to study them!
</p>
</div>

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I ran the random pair program, which generated the following pairs for this
next assignment:
</p><pre>
Anfal and Ved
Turner and Trostin
Adonis and Cody
Caleb and Luis
Johan and Jamethiel
Anar and Marin
Parker and Issac
Akshay and Jeff (the fix was in on this one ;-)
</pre><p>
We meet next on Tuesday, December 10th. Please come to class with working
solutions to the following problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a program in a file named <code>CHRNUMS.C</code>to prepend each
line of a text file with the number of characters in that line. Given a
file named <code>LINES.TXT</code> with content:
</p><pre>
This is a file
containing lines of
different
lengths.
</pre><p>
Running <code>CHRNUMS LINES.TXT</code> would print:
</p><pre>
15: This is a file
20: containing lines of
10: different
8:  lengths.
</pre></li>

<li>Complete <i>Exercise 1-17</i> on page 28 of <i>The C Programming
Language</i>.  Use the <code>reverse(s)</code> function you complete
in that exercise to write a program in a file named <code>BACKWARD.C</code>
that takes a text file as a command line argument and prints out each line in
the file backwards.</li>
</ol>
<p style="color: red;">
NOTE: Since I neglected to assign a due date to this, it will be evaluted
(by commit history) along with the next assignment on Tuesday, December
10th.

<h2>Wednesday, December 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
As I started experimenting with more and more C programs, I quickly ended up with a mess of files on my <code>I</code> drive.  I wanted to just run:
</p><pre>
I&gt;era *.*
</pre><p>
to start fresh, but then I realized that this would remove all the files needed
to compile C programs.  And what if I wanted to work on drive <code>J</code> or
drive <code>D</code>?
</p><p>
My familiarity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> files
called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file">batch files</a>, which are
similiar (if much less powerful) to Unix
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell scripts</a> led me
to wonder if <code>CP/M</code> had something similar. It turns out it does.
They are less powerful still than batch files (not surprisingly), but they
can help us out here. They work with the
<a href="http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch1.htm#Section_1.6.7">SUBMIT command</a>, and they use the file extention <code>.SUB</code>.
Here is the source to <code>CSTUFF.SUB</code>:
</p><pre>
PIP $1:=C:CC.COM
PIP $1:=C:CC2.COM
PIP $1:=C:CLINK.COM
PIP $1:=C:C.CCC
PIP $1:=C:DEFF.CRL
PIP $1:=C:DEFF2.CRL
PIP $1:=C:STDIO.H
</pre><p>
Copy this file to your <code>C</code> drive.  Then, if you want to use say
drive <code>J</code> for compiling C programs, you can just run:
</p><pre>
submit c:cstuff J
</pre><p>
and it will copy the 7 files you need from drive <code>C</code> to
<code>J</code>.
</p><p>
As I made my way through your repos this morning, I found the following
programs we should share today:
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PB22-School/csc215/refs/heads/main/MP2/C_stuff/clisum.c">Parker and Caleb</a>,
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudegod1/csc215/refs/heads/main/CLISUM.c">
Ved and Trostin</a>,
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Cody/csc215/raw/branch/main/C/clisum.c">Cody</a>
(<i>note:</i> Cody does the checking for numeric string I was hoping for),
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johan-franco/csc215/refs/heads/main/Cprogams/CLISUM.C">Johan and Anar</a>,
</p><p>
Far and away the top prize for best <q>do it yourself</q> solution goes to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/Jamethiel/csc215/raw/branch/main/c_code/CLISUM.C">
Jamethiel</a>. Her's is the one you should study if you want to really learn
C! My partner
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AkshayKuchibhatla/csc215/refs/heads/main/Programs/C_programs/clisum2.c">Akshay</a> has another one you should
review. Finally there is the one
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/CLISUM.C">
José Ejemplo</a> wrote before I gave you this assignment.
</p><p>
It turns out file I/O is not very difficult after all. Using <i>The Buffered
File I/O Functions</i> section on page 133 of the <i>BDS C User's Guide</i>,
José Ejemplo was able to write
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/MYCOPY.C">
MYCOPY.C</a>. We will look over this in class before you begin work on your
next assignment.
</p>
</div>

<h3>End of Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Continue working with your same partner for this iteration. Complete as many
of the following exercises as class time plus 90 minutes of homework time
allow: Exercises 1-6, 1-7 and 1-8 on page 18, and 1-9, 1-10 and 1-11 on
page 19 of <i>The C Programming Language</i>.
</p><p style="color: red;">
Your evaluation will be based on how well your git repo shows evidence of
<b>iterative development</b>. A single commit of completed work will only
earn you a D! <i>This assignment is due at 11:59 pm on Thursday, December
5th</i> so that I can evaluate it before class starts on Friday.

<h2>Monday, December 2nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
The grade distribution for the assembly language programming projects was:
<b>A</b>: 8, <b>B</b>: 3, and <b>E</b>: 4. I am fully aware how challenging it
is to understand a computer at the level needed to write in assembly. Those of
you who struggled will now get some welcome relief and an opportunity for a
fresh start. Hopefully you at least gained an appreciation for the challenge.
C provides enough <i>abstraction</i> of the machine that you will be able
to write C programs without reference to the details of the hardware on which
they are running.
</p><p>
We'll start class today by setting up a new development environment for
learning C programming on CP/M using BDS C.  I've created a
<a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-and-extract-archives-using-the-tar-command-in-linux/">
tar zip</a> file containing everything you'll need, and I developed
step-by-step instructions for getting you through <code>helloworld.c</code>.
</p><p>
Read
<a href="../resources/helloworld_with_bds_c.html">Hello World with BDS C</a>
and follow the steps until you have a running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello%2C_World!%22_program">Hello,
World! program</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I ran the random pair chooser, which gave us the following programming pairs
for this first assignment:
</p><pre>
Parker and Caleb
Johan and Anar
Issac and Anfal
Luis and Cody
Jamethiel and Turner
Ved and Trostin
Marin and Adonis
Akshay and Jeff
</pre><p>
Your task is to write a program named CLISUM that takes a sequence of integer
values at the CP/M command line and prints out their sum. An A submission
should gracefully handle invalid input. Sample runs might include:
</p><pre>
I&gt;clisum 5 15 22 8
Sum is 50
I&gt;clisum 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Sum is 7
I&gt;clisum 5 15 icecream 8
OOPS! ICECREAM is not a number
</pre><p>
In addition to the <code>ARGS.C</code> program I will share with you in class,
you should use the <code>ndigit</code> discussion beginning on page 20, and the
<code>atoi</code> discussion beginning on page 39 of <i>The C Programming
Language</i> as resources.
</p><p>
<span style="color: red;">This assignment is due <i>before</i> class starts
on Wednesday!</span> Pairs will have 5 minutes to present their solutions
during the first part of class. Credit will only be earned if you have the
presented source in your repo before class starts.
<i style="color: red;">Each of you must have it in your own repo to earn
credit!</i></span>
