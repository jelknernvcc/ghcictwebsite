<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I hope everyone had a restful Thanksgiving holiday and you've come back ready
to start programming in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>!  After
programming in binary, and then assembly langauge, I think you will
<i>greatly</i> appreciate the usability and power that a higher level
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming"> structured
programming</a> language like C gives us.
</p><p>
This will be an opportunity for those of you who struggled with the previous
project to start fresh!

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Grade distribution for the assembly language programmin projects was:
<b>A</b>: 8, <b>B</b>: 3, and <b>E</b>: 4. I understand how challenging it is
to understand a machine at the level needed to write in assembly. Those of you
who struggled will now get some welcome relief and an opportunity for a fresh
start.
</p><p>
We'll start class today by setting up a new development environment for
learning C programming on CP/M using BDS C.  I've created a
<a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-and-extract-archives-using-the-tar-command-in-linux/">
tar zip</a> file containing everything you'll need, and I developed
step-by-step instructions for getting you through <code>helloworld.c</code>.
</p><p>
Read
<a href="../resources/helloworld_with_bds_c.html">Hello World with BDS C</a>
and follow the steps until you have a running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello%2C_World!%22_program">Hello,
World! program</a>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I ran the random pair chooser, which gave us the following programming pairs
for this first assignment:
</p><pre>
Parker and Caleb
Johan and Anar
Issac and Anfal
Luis and Cody
Jamethiel and Turner
Ved and Trostin
Marin and Adonis
Akshay and Jeff
</pre><p>
Your task is to write a program named CLISUM that takes a sequence of integer
values at the CP/M command line and prints out their sum. An A submission
should gracefully handle invalid input. Sample runs might include:
</p><pre>
I&gt;clisum 5 15 22 8
Sum is 50
I&gt;clisum 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
Sum is 7
I&gt;clisum 5 15 icecream 8
OOPS! ICECREAM is not a number
</pre><p>
In addition to the <code>ARGS.C</code> program I shared in class, you should
use <code>ndigit</code> discussion beginning on page 20 of the book, and the
<code>atoi</code> discussion beginning on page 39 as resources.
</p><p>
<span style="color: red;">This assignment is due <i>before</i> class starts
on Wednesday!</span> Pairs will have 5 minutes to present their solutions
during the first part of class. Credit will only be earned if you have the
presented source in your repo before class starts.
<i style="color: red;">Each of you must have it in your own repo to earn
credit!</i></span>
