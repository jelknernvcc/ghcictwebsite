<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Welcome to 2nd Quarter! We'll be spending the first half of this quarter
learning assembly language programming on CP/M, and the second half learning
a dialect of C for that same environment.  Let's dive right in...

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Aksay and Jeff will start class by presenting summaries of the first three
of the four chapters in <i>Part IV: A Library of User Subroutines</i>. Everyone
in class will have to carefully read each of these chapters on their own,
learning to use CP/M's editor, ed, along the way, as well as the assembly
language programming workflow.
</p><p>
The summary presentations today are only meant to get you started with that
process.
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Chapter 11: Learning by Doing</i> - Akshay</li>
<li><i>Chapter 12: Console Input/Output</i> - Jeff</li>
<li><i>Chapter 13: Buffered Input/Output</i> - Jeff</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create space in your git repo for the work you will be doing this quarter.
I suggest making subdirectories for both code and notes for each chapter.
</p><p>
Read <i>Chapter 11: Learning by Doing</i> thoroughly, taking notes and
practicing with the CP/M editor as you do. I highly recommend you use
<a href="https://techtinkering.com/articles/i-love-ed-on-cpm/">I Love ED on
CP/M</a> as an additional resource as you learn the editor.
</p><p>
Repos will be evaluated using our new
<a href="../resources/class_git_repo_rubric.html">class git repo rubric</a>.
