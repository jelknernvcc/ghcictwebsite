<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In the two weeks we have until Winter break, we will begin a fairly large
project which can use to transition from BDS C on CP/M to C++ on Unix.
</p><p>
The random pairs Python choose for this project are:
</p><pre>
Turner and Trostin
Caleb and Anar
Parker and Luis
Marin and Adonis
Anfal and Johan
Ved and Cody
Issac and Jamethiel
Akshay and Jeff
</pre><p>
To motivate what we are going to do, I want you to download, compile and run
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/BIGGEST.C">
BIGGEST.C</a> and
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/FIXEDPT.C">
FIXEDPT.C</a>. Then download
<a href="https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/ap01.pdf.lr_7928.pdf">The
Large Integer Case Study in C++</a>. To quote the problem statement on page one
of the case study,
</p><blockquote>
Arithmetic operations are fundamental in computing and programming. In many
programming environments the largest value of an integer variable is much too
small to represent large quantities such as the population of the world, the
U.S. national debt, the number of occurrences of the letter 'e' in Melvilleâ€™s
Moby Dick.
</blockquote><p>
This is <i>definitely true</i> in our Altair 8800 BSD C environment. As you
can see from running the <code>BIGGEST.C</code> program, the largest signed
integer we can store is <code>32767</code>. That's not even large enough to
hold an APS teacher's yearly salary! ;-)
</p><p>
In this project we will use <i>The Large Integer Case Study in C++</i> as a
guide to implement a <code>bigint</code> 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">
struct</a> in BSD C.

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll start class today by getting a copy of
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/C/CPM_BDSC/Programs/CALC.C">
CALC.C</a>, which implements a BDS C version of the calculator program from
<i>Appendix A: The Calculator</i> in <i>The Large Integer Case Study in
C++</i>.
</p><p>
Then we will discuss the assignment given last class (when I was out), and
decide on a good path forward.

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
The <code>day_of_year</code> and <code>month_day</code> functions are presented
on page 104 of <i>The C Programming Language</i>. Study these functions until
you understand how they work (i.e. write a small test program to experiment
with them). 
</p><p>
Then complete <i>Exercise 5-6</i> on page 110, which asks you to rewrite these
functions using pointers instead of indexing.
</p><p style="color: red;">
To earn an A on your next evaluation, <i>commits made both during class and
between classes</i> must contain evidence of the effective use of the 3 hours
of time you have allotted to work on this, even if you can't complete it.
This and the previous assignment are both due tomorrow, Wednesday, December
11 at 1 pm so I have time to evaluate them before we meet on Thursday. If
you've been slacking, you need to put in more than 3 hours to make up for
what you didn't do last class!
