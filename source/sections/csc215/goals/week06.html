<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will continue with our study of
<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/osborne/books/CPM_Assembly_Language_Programming_1983.pdf">
CP/M Assembly Language Programming: A Guide to the Integrated Learning of the
CP/M Operating System & Assembly Language Programming</a>, diving into the
details of the CP/M operating system.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today in class we will discuss <i>Chapter 3: The CP/M-Based Computer</i>. 
This book thankfully only assumes a "minimum size microcomputer running some
standard version of of the CP/M operating system."  We are running CP/M version
2.2, the most recent of these "standard versions."
</p><p>
The author tells us that we will use the term <b>CRT</b> (which stands for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube">cathod-ray tube</a>)
as the term we will use of the physical device we use to communicate with
our computer.
</p><p>
In our specific case, our <b>CRT</b> will consist of our computer keyboard,
together with a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal
application</a> in which we run
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> configured to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator">emulate</a> the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a> running
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M">CP/M</a>.
</p><p>
We will need to make reference to Figure 3-1 as we proceed with our study:
</p><p class="illustration">
<img src="resources/figure_3-1.png" alt="Figure 3-1">
</p><p>
Make note of the comment in the figure intro text that says <q>[w]hile the
schematic representations of the device selectors indicate real switches,
<i>the switching is actually accomplished by selectively accessing different
device driver subroutines with the operating system in response to bit patterns
stored in the IOBYT.</i></q>
</p><p>
Also take a moment to reflect on our entire setup here in light of the
statement I made in class last time that
<i style="color: red;">hardware and software are logically equivalent</i>.

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Let's choose pairs to present summaries of the next two chapters:
<i>Chapter 4: What the Operating System Provides</i> and
<i>Chapter 5: Organization of CP/M</i>. Everone should read both these
chapters for homework with an eye towards understanding.  We won't be able to
effectively use our systems if we don't understand how they work.
