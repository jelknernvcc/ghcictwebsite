<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will begin using the
<a href="https://www.bdsoft.com/resources/bdsc.html">BD Software C Compiler</a>
to write programs in C on our Altair 8800 simulator.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Friday, October 27th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
This was my orginial plan for today:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Today we will begin learning C programming on the Altair 8800. As befits our
whirwind tour through PC programming history, we will begin this journey with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#K&R_C">K&amp;R
C</a>, using the first edition of the classic book
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C
Programming Language</a>.
</p><p>
Download <a href="resources/Altair8800.tgz"
download="Altair8800.tgz">Altair8800.tgz</a>, in which you will find both the
Altair 8800 simulator environment with BDS C compiler and a copy of two books,
<i>The C Programming Language</i> and <i>BDS C User's Guide</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Alas, to quote Robert Burns, <q>The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men
Gang aft agley, An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, For promis'd joy!</q>
</p><p>
After spending my allotted 90 minutes of <q>homework time</q> trying to get
simple C programs to compile on the Altair, I realized that the environment is
too challenging, and Nate's suggestion that we abandon our dear Altair 8800 at
this point and move to a modern Unix platform for our study of C sounds like a
better plan.
</p><p>
Today in class I will give you a PDF of <i>The C Programming Language, 2nd
Edition</i>, and we will begin working our way through it. This little book
makes an excellent text, and will provide us with both direction and
accountability.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Julissa, Edward, Cyrus, and Joseph will read <i>Chapter 1: A Tutorial
Introduction</i> from <i>The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition</i>.
Julissa and Edward will prepare a summary of sections 1.1. through 1.4, and
come to class next Tuesday prepared to show us a complete working version of
the Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion program developed in those sections.
</p><p>
Cyrus and Joseph will prepare a summary of sections 1.5 through 1.8 and come to
class Tuesday with the counting programs and power function developed in
those sections.
</p><p>
Jeff will prepare a summary of <i>Section 1.9: Character Arrays</i>, and come
to class Tuesday with the getline and copy functions developed in that
section, as well has a few other example programs using character arrays.
</p><p>
Nate and Sheel will work continue to work with me on trying to get C programs
compiled for the Altair. Liam shared several working programs with me, which
provided a much better sense of the differences (which are significant, but
not terrible) between Unix C and BDS C.

<h2>Wednesday, October 25th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class by checking that each of you can assemble and run the
<code>ACC.ASM</code> program assigned <a href="week08.html">last Thursday</a>
on your laptop.
</p><p>
After that I will introduce the
<a href="https://www.bdsoft.com/resources/bdsc.html">BD Software C Compiler</a>
and share the experiments I did over the weekend using it, inviting you to help
solve a mystery I encountered.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Get a working BSD C developing environment setup on your laptop.
</p>

<h2>Monday, October 23rd</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p style="color:red;">
I am out sick today, so unfortunately, the plan to demonstrate your
<code>ACC.ASM</code> programs will have to wait until Wednesday.
</p><p>
Use today's classwork and homework time to read about the
<a href="https://www.bdsoft.com/resources/bdsc.html">BD Software C Compiler
</a>, which we will begin using when I return.
