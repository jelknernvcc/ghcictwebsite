<p>
We will begin class with presentations by
Anfal and Luis on <i>Chapter 4: What the System Provides</i>, and by Akshay
and Ved on <i>Chapter 5: Organization of CP/M</i>.
</p><p>
There is <i>a lot</i> of detailed material in these chapters, and I realize
we need to put in the time we need to begin to absorb it into our understanding
if we are going to use CP/M effectively.  Let's reflect on how well we think
we've done that after the presentations.
</p><p>
We will also ask for two more volunteers who have not presented yet to take
on <i>Chapter 6: Interfacing with CP/M</i> for our Thursday class.
