<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we explore the process by which our computer starts up and how we
can coax it into loading an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a>.
We will also begin to think about what an operating system is and what
resources it provides us.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Edward and Sheel will present the key ideas we need to understand from 
<i>Chapter 3: The CP/M-Based Computer</i> and <i>Chapter 4: What the
Operating System Provides</i>. After that we will choose the pair to present
the next two chapters in class on Tuesday, October 17th.
</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Chapter 5: Organization Of CP/M</i> and <i>Chapter 6: Interfacing With

<h2>Monday, October 7th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin with Nate's summary of
<i>Chapter 2: Software Components Of the Computer System</i>, which we will
then discuss, focusing on the core feature of an operating system, providing
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> for application programs
that <i>abstracts hardware</i> - including providing a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>, memory
management, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver">device
drivers</a>. 
</p><p>
We'll also talk briefly about a few of the things we will not be investigating
this year. If time permitted, it would have been really cool to run the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70l6CE0mWbs">serial I/O echo
routine</a>, which provides about a simple an introduction at possible to
device drivers. Since we agreed that we need to move with deliberate speed
toward C programming, we will have to skip this and other detours from our
destination path this year.
