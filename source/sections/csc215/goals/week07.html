<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet twice during this 3-day week, and we will use the the opportunity to
continue laying the foundation for assembly language programming under CP/M.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, October 10th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Circumstances have developed that are prompting me to propose a short term
change in our plans.  Both another <a href="https://altairclone.com/">Altair
8800 clone</a> <i>and</i> two
<a href="https://adwaterandstir.com/altair/">Altair-Duino</a>'s are now in
our classroom (take a look at the back of the room). Since each of these
machines operate somewhat differently and offer somewhat different features
(while both replicate the Altair 8800 programming experience), I want to
propose using this opportunity to do some real
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning">problem-based
learning</a>.
</p><p>
To solve the <q>problem</q> of learning to use these two machines,
<i>Parker, Turner, Akshay and Isaac</i> will take a deep dive into learning to
use the Altair Clone, and make a <q>How to</q> presentation on what they learn.
<i>Luis, Anfal, Ved and Jametheil</i> will do the same thing with the
Altair-Duino.
</p><p>
The rest of us can then divide up the work of presenting clear summaries of
the chapters in <i>CP/M Assembly Language Programming</i> up to and including
<i>Chapter 11: Learning by Doing</i>, which Akshay and I will present.
</p><p>
Here are the remaining chapters to be discussed:
</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Chapter 5: Organizaiton of CP/M</i> - Ved</li>
<li><i>Chapter 6: Interfacing with CP/M</i> - Adonis</li>
<li><i>Chapter 7: Assembly Language Programming</i> - Cody and Marin</li>
<li><i>Chapter 9: Register Usage in the 8080</i> - Anar and Caleb</li>
<li><i>Chapter 10: Preserving the User's Environment</i> - Trostin</li>
<li><i>Chapter 11: Learning by Doing</i> - Akshay and Jeff</li>
</ol>
<p>
After parcelling out this labor we will watch the long promised section of
the 1999 documentary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Nerds">Triumph of the
Nerds</a> that deals with the history of the Altair.

<h2>Monday, October 7th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with presentations by
Anfal and Luis on <i>Chapter 4: What the System Provides</i>, and by Akshay
and Ved on <i>Chapter 5: Organization of CP/M</i>.
</p><p>
There is <i>a lot</i> of detailed material in these chapters, and I realize
we need to put in the time we need to begin to absorb it into our understanding
if we are going to use CP/M effectively.  Let's reflect on how well we think
we've done that after the presentations.
</p><p>
We will also ask for two more volunteers who have not presented yet to take
on <i>Chapter 6: Interfacing with CP/M</i> for our Thursday class.
