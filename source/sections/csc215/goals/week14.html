<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will complete a project to create
a <a href="https://base64.guru/converter">Base64 converter</a>. Scores on the
quiz you took last week were excellent, indicating that you all have the
understanding of bitwise operatings required. This project provides an
excellent opportunity to apply your understanding to an interesting real-world
problem.
