<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
As I mentioned last class, based on Nate's reply to Caleb's email, I would
decide whether we should continue living in the late 1970's or to jump
forward 40 some years to the present. Well, we are going to do the latter.
</p><p>
Welcome back to the 21st century! ;-)

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
We are in our final project period now for <code>CSC 215</code>, and I have
the following students working on the following projects:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cards:</b> Isaac, Turner, Parker and Akshay</li>
<li><b>Arbitrary Precision Rational Numbers:</b> Caleb</li>
<li><b>BigInts:</b> Ved, Anfal, Trostin, Jamethiel, Anar, Cody, Luis, Marin,
Adonis and Johan</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: red;">
Since this will mostly be a process based evaluation, I reserve the right to
evaluate your progress <i>at any time</i>.  An A evaluation will require
commits both during and between each class period showing clear evidence of
ongoing engagement with the project.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we are going to learn to use another development tool,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a>.
</p><p>
I have long wanted to learn to use this powerful tool, but I never found the
right learning resource for this powerful yet complex tool. At long last,
I think I found it:
<a href="https://makefiletutorial.com/">Learn Makefiles With the tastiest
examples</a>.
</p><p>
We will use today's class time to work through this tutorial.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Task</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a subdirectory in your git repo named <code>LearnMake</code>. Each time
you finish one of the examples in the tutorial, make a commit so that your
versions of <code>Makefile</code> are saved in your commit history.
</p><p>
A series of commits both during and between now and next class are expected
for you to earn an A for this task. You can take a peak at what our friend
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc222/src/branch/master/LearnMake">Jos√©
Ejemplo</a> did to get inspiration.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete as much of
<a href="https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/cpp/exercises/ch14/ch14s01.html">
Chapter 14 Exercise Set 1: BigInt Case Study</a> as your 90 minutes of
homework time permits.
</p><p style="color: red;">
An A evaluation requires a series of commits to your repo showing evidence of
incremental development.
