<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>
This is it, the last week of <i>CSC 215: Computer Systems</i>! We explored 
<i>a lot</i> this semester, and hopefully you are leaving this course with a
much deeper understanding of what computers are and how they do what they do. 
We'll tack on next Tuesday to this last week. When you come in at the start
of February, you will be in <i>CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of
Algorithms</i>.
</p><p>
That said, from a practical point of view you won't feel any difference, since
we've fused these two courses together in our study plan, and have already
made the transition from this course, with its computing enviroment very
much part of the 20th century, to the next one, leaping 50 years forward.
</p>
To recap and for easy reference, here are the project groups:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>BigInts:</b> Ved, Anfal, Trostin, Jamethiel, Anar, Cody, Luis, Marin,
Adonis, Johan, and Isaac</li>
<li><b>Cards:</b>Turner, Parker and Akshay</li>
<li><b>Arbitrary Precision Rational Numbers:</b> Caleb</li>
</ul>

<h3>Classwork / Homework / Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
Evaluations of your git repos were less than stellar overall. We've been
struggling in this class with an outbreak of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senioritis">senioritis</a> and sadly,
it shows :-( I guess if y'all are already admitted to the colleges you want to
get into, than all you need to to is not fail, so I'll need to adjust my
expectations accordingly. The grade distribution was: <b>A</b>: 4, <b>B</b>: 1,
<b>C</b>: 4, <b>D</b>: 4, and <b>E</b>: 2.
</p><p>
I still need to hold you accountable, even if you no longer plan to hold 
yourselves accountable, so unless things change, expect your grades to decline.
I assert that you can only learn to program by programming, so putting in the
time is essential if you want to learn to program and be ready for what you
will be expected to do after you leave ACC (<i>Jelkner gets down from his
soapbox)</i>.
</p><p>
Our hardworking, overachieving friend
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215">José Ejemplo</a> put in 5 hours
working on <code>BigInt</code> this past weekend, and he got the overloaded
<code>+</code> operator to work for positive <code>BigInt</code>s as well as
helping me prepare today's lesson.
</p><p>
I'll take a few minutes to describe how he did it, including taking a
look at his
<a href="../../csc222/goals/resources/JoseEjemploBigIntCommits.png">commit
history</a>.  I've mentioned in class several times now the quote 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Uncle Bob</a> shares 
in his book <i>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</i> by
UML creator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch">Grady Booch</a>
who said,
</p><blockquote>
Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose.
Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp
abstractions and straightforward lines of control.
</blockquote><p>
For those of you who aspire to become highly skilled software engineers,
I encourage you to read over the blog post by Brian Norlander,
<a href="https://medium.com/@bpnorlander/stop-writing-code-comments-28fef5272752">Stop
Writing Code Comments</a>.
</p><p>
Your final evaluation for this course will done immediately after class ends
on Tuesday, January 28th, and will consist of two parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A <i>process</i> grade (50%) that will be evaluated as we have been, based
on the evidence of <i>regular engagement</i> and an <i>iterative development
process</i> in your git repo.</li>

<li>A <i>product</i> grade (50%) that will evaluate how well you deliver a
working, well written software application.</li>
</ol>
