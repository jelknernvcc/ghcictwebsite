<h2>Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>
This is it, the last week of <i>CSC 215: Computer Systems</i>! We explored 
<i>a lot</i> this semester, and hopefully you are leaving this course with a
much deeper understanding of what computers are and how they do what they do. 
We'll tack on next Tuesday to this last week. When you come in at the start
of February, you will be in <i>CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of
Algorithms</i>.
</p><p>
That said, from a practical point of view you won't feel any difference, since
we've fused these two courses together in our study plan, and have already
made the transition from this course, with its computing enviroment very
much part of the 20th century, to the next one, leaping 50 years forward.
</p>
To recap and for easy reference, here are the project groups:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>BigInts:</b> Ved, Anfal, Trostin, Jamethiel, Anar, Cody, Luis, Marin,
Adonis, Johan, and Isaac</li>
<li><b>Cards:</b>Turner, Parker and Akshay</li>
<li><b>Arbitrary Precision Rational Numbers:</b> Caleb</li>
</ul>
