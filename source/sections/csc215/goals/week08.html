<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
As we agreed at the start of class on Tuesday, we will depart from our linear
march through our text taking notes, and jump ahead to do the equivalent of
<q>hello world</q> in assembly language.
</p>

<h2>Thursday, October 19th</h2>

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Use both classwork and homework time to complete the assignment given Tuesday.
<i>Each of you should come to class on Monday prepared to show your running
program on your school laptop.</i>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
To earn an A for this week's evaluation, you much have <code>ACC.ASM</code>
on your school laptop, and be able to assembly it into a running program
in your Altair 8800 simulator that will display <q>ACC</q> when run.
</p>

The following pairs will work together to write, assemble and run a program
named <code>ACC.ASM</code> that will print the letters <q>ACC</q> to the screen

<ul>
  <li>Edward and Julissa</li>
  <li>Joseph and Cyrus</li>

Your task is to do each of the following before the start of class on
Monday, October 23rd:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Extend the program in <i>Listing 7-1</i> of our book (on page 74) so
  it prints <q>ACC</q> instead of just <q>$</q>. Put our source listing

  <li>Move <code>ACC.ASM</code> from your host computer to the third virtual
  disk of your Altair 8800 simulator (DRIVE C:).</li>
