<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
I have two alternative plans for what we do next, which will depend on our
feedback from the last programming assignment.  We will decide together in
class whether to spend a bit more time understanding the architecture of our
computer, or moving on.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today we will take a first look at the book we will be using for the next phase
of our learning,
<a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/osborne/books/CPM_Assembly_Language_Programming_1983.pdf">CP/M Assembly Language Proramming</a>, but Ken Barbier.
</p><p>
Before we can begin using this book, however, we need to move from the online
Altair 8800 simulator we have been using to a more full-featured one. Today in
class we will take care of that.
</p><p>
Download <a href="resources/LiamsAltairConfig.tgz"
download="LiamsAltairConfig.tgz">LiamsAltairConfig.tgz</a>, extract it and add
the <code>altairz80</code> program appropriate for your host operating system.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Chapter 1: Hardware Components Of the Computer System</i>, taking
detailed notes in our git repo in a file named
<code>HardwareComponents.md</code>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<div>
<p>
I will expect to see notes that indicate an understanding of the chapter
content.
