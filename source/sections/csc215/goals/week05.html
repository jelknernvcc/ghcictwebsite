<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I've setup a Google group for our class, and included my dear friend and
machine language mentor, Kevin Cole, in the list, so we can use it to
communicate with him.
</p><p>
I'll talk to Cody and Anar today about asking him for a good, clear, as simple
as possible example or two of machine language programs using the
<code>CALL</code> instruction.  He may want to send them links to assembly
language programs he wrote for students in previous years, and then it would
be their task to convert them into machine language programs in hex.
</p><p>
Let's also get volunteers to take responsibility for presenting good summaries
of:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Preface</li>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Chapter 1: Hardware Components of the Computer System</li>
