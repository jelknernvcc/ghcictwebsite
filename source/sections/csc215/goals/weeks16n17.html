<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
With only one day in week 17, we'll combine weeks 16 and 17 together. These
two weeks we will read the chapters on arrays (chapter 3) and strings
(chapter 4) in our textbook, completing a collection of programming exercises
from each.

<p>
The books have arrived, so we will now be freed to use materials from any
chapter. We will begin with <i>Chapter 4: Strings</i> immediately upon our
return in 2024.
</p><p>
If you have not already done so, today is your last opportunity to complete
array programs 1 through 5 and 7 through 10 on page 113 of our text.
<i>You must have working solutions for all of these to earn an A for this
assignment.</i>

<h2>Monday, December 11th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll start class by sharing and comparing our solutions to the exercises
assigned <a href="week15.html">last class</a>. We will then take a look at
<i>Chapter 3: Arrays</i> in our text. This chapter is a review of a discussion
we have already had, but it goes into considerably more detail.  
</p><p>
Since the best way become a better programer is by getting lots of experience
programming, and reflecting on and drawing lessons from that experience, that's
just what we'll do.  We'll spend several classes working exercises from the
end of this chapter, beginning with the first exercise.
</p><p>
I've created <a href="../resources/gcc_on_windows.html">
Installing and Configuring GCC on Windows</a>. We will take a look at it in
class.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Complete exercise 1 from the <i>Programming Exercises</i> on page 113 of our
text. Come to class Wednesday prepared to share your solution.
