  <th>A</th>
  <td>
  An CP/M assembly language program is presented that assembles, loads, and
  runs on the Altair 8080 computer (either the simulator or our classroom
  machine). It uses the I/O library routines developed in the book,
  <i>CP/M Assembly Language Programming</i>, to read input from the user
  at the CP/M prompt, process that information in some meaningful way, and
  then output the processed information back to the user using the CP/M
  command-line interface. For an A, the program should effectively handle
  user input, catching bad input and prompting the user to correct their
  input error.

  and does not have to handle invalid input.

  that prevent it from producing correct output, but it still reads data from
  the user and produces some output to the console.

  Some work was completed, but it shows only minimal effort and does not
  provide sufficient evidence of learning mastery.
