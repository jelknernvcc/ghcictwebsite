<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Happy New Year! This week we will take a deep dive into using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a>
in C.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, January 4th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll begin today by having you share your working example programs and
responses to the review questions assigned on Tuesday. We will then
continue to work our way through <i>Chapter 4: Strings</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read from page 123, beginning with the <i>Reversing a String</i> section,
through the end of section 4.2 on page 129. Make sure you have working versions
of all the programs from this reading in your git repo before you come to
class on Monday.
</p><p>
Complete <i>Programming Exercises</i> 2 to 5, 7 and 9. For each of these
you should write a function that accepts an input string and returns the
appropriate value (either a modified string or an integer).
</p><p>
Extra credit if you can use doctest to test your solution. Even better if
write the doctests <i>before</i> you write your solution!

<h2>Tuesday, January 2nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
I'll begin class today by sharing and discussing several small programs that
illustrate the use of null terminated strings in C.
</p><p>
Strings in C are arrays of <code>char</code>s terminated by a <b>null</b>
character (<code>'\0'</code>). That means a string of length 10 can hold only
9 characters, since one element is occupied by the terminating null.

<a href="resources/c_progs/01_str_vs_char.c">01_str_vs_char.c</a>
</p><p>
The
<a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/">string.h</a> library
provides several useful functions for copying and comparing strings, two of
which, <code>strlen</code> and <code>strcmp</code>, are used here:

<h3>Adaptations to Our Textbook Source</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will need to make a few adaptations to the source code examples presented
in our textbook since we do not have <code>conio.h</code> and since the
<code>gets</code> function is deprecated.
</p><p>
We will replace calls to <code>gets</code> with calls to
<a href="https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fgets/">fgets</a>.
<code>fgets</code> requires two additional arguments, <code>num</code>, set to
the maximum length of the string being read, and <code>stream</code>, and
pointer to the file stream from which to read the string. Since we want this
last value to be standard input, we will pass <code>stdin</code> for this
last paramemter.
</p><p>
For an example of this adaptation, the call to:
</p><pre>
gets(str);
</pre><p>
in programming example 1 on page 119 of our text will be replaced with:
</p><pre>
fgets(str, 100, stdin);
</pre><p>
We also need a replacement for the function <code>getch</code>. I've updated
<a href="https://codeberg.org/ACC/csc215/raw/branch/master/DataStructuresUsingC/resources/console_utils.h">
console_utils.h</a> to add a <code>getch</code> function. We'll take a few
minutes during class to confirm that you can compile and run the example
programs on page 119 of our text using these adaptations.
<p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Chapter 4: Strings</i> from page 115 to page 123. You should adapt the
5 progam examples from this section using the methods presented today in class,
and confirm that you can compile and run them.
</p><p>
Complete <i>Review Questions</i> 1 to 5, 13, and 18 on page 135 of our text.
