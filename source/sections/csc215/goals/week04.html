<h3>Classwork</h3>

We will begin class by having each pair write on the whiteboard at the front
of the room which
<a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/appendix.html">Altair
8800 instruction</a> they plan to introduce with their program.
</p><p>
Using that information, we will devise a presentation schedule for the
remainder of the week, with two presentations today and three presentations
on Wednesday and Friday.
</p><p>
Recall that the presentation pairs for this are Caleb and Trostin, Isaac and
Adonis, Akshay and Johan, Turner and Anfal, Parker and Marin, Jamethiel and
Luis, Cody and Anar, and Ved and Jeff.
