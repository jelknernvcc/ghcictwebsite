<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Some of you have heard me say on more than one occassion, <q>it's all just
bits.</q>  This semester we are going to dig deeply into that saying, and I'll
start the discussion with this introduction to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> number
systems.  I'll discuss what they are, why we use them, and why we need to
become very comfortable with them to program the Altair 8800.
</p>

<h2>Number Systems</h2>
<p>
The Altair manual has a very brief section titled <q>Number Systems</q> which
on careful reading reveals that what is being discussed is more properly
referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">numeral
system</a>, and that what is really at issue is the Altair 8800's use of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation">positional
numeral system</a> in <b>base-2</b> (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix">radix</a> Wikipedia entry for
more on that).
</p><p>
I only want to draw your attention here to the fact that positional number
systems are not the only numbers systems humans have used.  Most of you are
probably at least somewhat familiar with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals">Roman numeral
system</a>, which is <i>not</i> a positional number system.</p>

<h2>Bits and Binary Numbers</h2>
<p>
The word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a> is a portmanteau
of <b>binary digit</b>. In information theory is it the smallest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Units_of_information">unit of
information</a>, since it holds one of only two possible values, usually
represented by <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>, <b>on</b> and <b>off</b>, or
<b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.
</p><p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary number</a> is
a number expressed in <b>base-2</b>, which means it can be represented
physically by bits.
</p><p>
For both engineering and mathematical reasons, almost all the computers in
common use today are <i>binary digital computers</i>, which means they store
and electronically operate on bits.
</p>

<h2>Octal and Hexadecimal Numbers</h2>
<p>
While the Altair 8800 uses binary numbers, these numbers, while very practical
for machines, are much less so for humans, animals which seem to process
things that vary in their environments more effectively than things which are
all the same.  We humans do not do well with long strings of <code>1</code>s
and <code>0</code>s, go computer scientists early on started using numerical
bases that represented <i>groups of bits</i>, thus providing more variety in
the representation of numbers.
</p><p>
Any base which is a power of 2, such as 2<sup>3</sup>, or 8 (called
<b>octal</b>), and 2<sup>4</sup>, or 16 (called <b>hexidecimal</b>), can map
easily to the binary number system, since one digit in these two systems
maps <i>directly</i> to 3 or 4 binary digits respectively.
</p><p>
After three years working with the Altair 8800, I am still not sure why the
documentation uses octal, but I think it is because it maps most conveniently
with the <a href="https://ubuntourist.codeberg.page/Altair-8800/appendix.html">
instruction set</a> of the machine.  As you will soon see, the grouping of bits
on the front panel of the computer is arranged in octal.
</p><p>
Since the Altair 8800 has an <i>8-bit processor</i> and a <i>16-bit memory
address space</i>, however, we will often find it much more convenient to use
hexadecimal numbers. Experience from the past few years showed that we will
need to become very comfortable with both systems.
</p><p>
The good news is that you will leave this experience with a solid foundation
in numberal systems used on computers. When life gives you lemons, <i>make
lemonade!</i> ;-)
