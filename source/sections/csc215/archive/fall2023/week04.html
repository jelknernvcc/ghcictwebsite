<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
We meet three times this week, so we have a great opportunity to make
significant progress toward learning how to program the Altair.
</p><p>
Thanks to the wonderful efforts of Jason and Edward, we are ready to load
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M">CP/M</a> in our Altair clone.
We won't be doing that this week, but it is nice to know we are ready.

<h2>Wednesday, September 18th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today in class we will share the programs that we were not ready to share
on Monday. After that, we will work on the homework problem as time permits.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Write a program that reads a value from memory address <code>0x0050</code>,
and then increments that value by one ten times, storing each incremented
value in the next location in memory.
</p><p>
For example, if the value found at address <code>0x0050</code> was
<code>00001010</code>, after your program runs the values at memory addresses
<code>0x0051</code> through <code>0x005A</code> would be <code>00001011</code>
through <code>00010100</code> respectively.
</p><p>
Pairings for this assignment are Nate and Edward, Cyrus and Joseph, and
Julissa and Sheel.
