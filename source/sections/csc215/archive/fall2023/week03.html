into the Altair simulator and run them.

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
Today in class we will share our binary programs for the Altair 8800, after
which I'll introduced you to 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/jelkner/csc215/-/tree/master/Altair8800/SimulatorProgramConverter">MITS
Altair Simulator Program Converter</a>, a python program to allow you to write
your next program in hex before uploading it to the Altair simulator.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Create a source file for <code>altair_sim_prog_converter</code> and come to
class next Monday ready to show off what you did. This will be your second
program for the Altair, since you have more time to work on it and are
hopefully beginning to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok">grok</a>
the functioning of the Altair, I hope this second program will be at least
a wee bit more ambitious than the first.
