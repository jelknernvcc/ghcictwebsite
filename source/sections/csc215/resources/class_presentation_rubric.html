  the class remember them. <i>Careful thought is evident of both the learning
  objective of the presentation and how to effectively guide the class
  (the audience) toward understanding that objective.</i> In addition to our
  Altair Manual, there is evidence that additional resources are utilized (and
  credited) that reinforce and/or supplement understanding of the topic.

  All presentations should be created in
  <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown</a> files
