<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will share our pair solutions to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_expression_tree">expression
tree</a> assignment given <a href="week11.html">last week</a>.

<p>
On Thursday Edward, Julissa, and Cyrus will share the solutions their
pairs developed to parse a <i>fully parenthesized infix arithmetic
expression</i>, build an expression tree, evaluate the expression, returning
a number, and finally returning a <i>postfix expression</i>.
</p><p>
It wasn't too hard to come up with the final binary tree challenge I would
like us to do, since it is in our textbook, and also since I fondly remember
implementing it back when I took this class in the 1990s (yes, I'm <i>that
old</i> ;-) Let's write a program to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">losslessly compress</a> 
<a href="../resources/alice_in_wonderland.txt">Alice in Wonderland</a> using a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman code</a>.
</p><p>
Since we will only be dealing with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> characters as data,
we could do this in C, but I'll leave that to you.  It would be great if you
wanted to divide into pairs again, with two pairs doing this in Python, and
one doing it in C.
