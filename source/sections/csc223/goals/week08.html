<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will finish our study of the the the the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type">ADT</a>.

<h2>Thursday, March 21st</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we will share and discuss our stack application code.
Joseph and Nate won't be here, but those of us who are will share what we
have.
</p><p>
Nate has an excellent summary of the
<a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/csc223/blob/main/notes/applicationsofstacks.md">
Applications of Stacks</a> with which we all need to become familiar.
</p><p>
While we will move on to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)">queues</a>
for tonight's homework, I'll work on a formal evaluation (i.e. a <q>test</q>)
for our stack study over Spring break.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read the first three sections of  <i>Chapter 3: Queues</i> on pages 253 to
260, taking notes in your git repo.  We will once again implement this ADT
using both linked lists and arrays, only this time the array implementation
is a bit more ornery then it was for stacks, while the linked list
implementation is just as easy.

<h2>Tuesday, March 19th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We'll start class with a quick check-in as to the completed state of our
two stack implementations in
<a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/libcsc223">libcsc223</a>.
</p><p>
Then we'll work in the groups you decided upon while I was out sick on the
stack applications you planned last week. I still don't know what those are,
so you will have to share them with me.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
According to the three folks here today (Edward, Cyrus, and Sheel),
Julissa is working on parentheses matching, Joseph is going to reverse a
list using a stack, and Nate is working on the two recursive algorithms,
Fibinacci and Towers of Hanoi.
</p><p>
Sheel is working infix to postfix and infix to prefix, Edward is working
evaluating postfix expressions, and Cyrus is working evaluating prefix
expressions.
