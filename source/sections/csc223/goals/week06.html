<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Due to our originally unplanned day off on Tuesday, we will meet only once
this week.

<h3>Classwork / Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
I was generally pleased when evaluating your assigned homework. Four of you
earned A's, one of you a C, and one of you was a no show. While 6 A's would
of course have been much preferred, the present result indicates that we are
ready to do as we planned today and:
</p>
<ul>
<li>divide yourselves into two groups of three people.</li>
<li>assign one group to implement the
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/stack.html">NIST stack ADT</a>
using arrays, and another using linked lists. Let's follow NIST's naming
conventions with one exception - let's use <code>pop</code> instead of
<code>popoff</code>.</li>
<li>be ready to share your completed work when we arrive in class next
Monday.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's try having each group work in it's own git branch of
<a href="https://github.com/NateLevin1/libcsc223">libcsc223</a>, merging these
branches into the main branch at the start of class on Monday.
