<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This week we will continue our study of <i>Chapter 6: Linked Lists</i>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Thursday, February 22nd</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
During class today we will begin sharing our implementations of the circular
list functions assigned last class, starting with <code>print_clist</code> and
<code>clist_insert_in_order</code>.  Since Nate's implementation of
<code>clist_insert_in_order</code> creates a <i>descending</i> clist, let's
work in our same groups to change it to <i>ascending</i> (thus making Joseph's
<q>0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4</q> work the way he wants it to ;-)
</p><p>
With the remaining time in class, work to finish the clist functions you were
assigned last class, using our now shared <code>print_clist</code> to simply
writing your tests. Finish this for homework if you don't finish in class.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Read <i>Section 6.4: Doubly Linked Lists</i> on pages 188 to 199 in our
textbook. Come to class on Monday ready to implement doubly linked list
functions with a new partner during class.

<h2>Tuesday, February 20th</h2>

<h3>Classwork</h3>
<div>
<p>
We will begin class with a presentation of the work I did over the weekend
to complete implementations of <code>insert_in_order</code> and
<code>remove_from_list</code>. This discussion will also focus on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> of
both code and tests, and how using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> made
refactoring so much easier to do.
</p><p>
After that presentation, we will discuss what to do about
<code>insert_in_order</code>, since it currently assumes a descending list.
Do we want to support both ascendind and descending lists? What about adding
functions <code>insert_before</code> and/or <code>insert_after</code>?
Also, are we happy with the way <code>remove_from_list</code> is currently
implemented?  It returns a pointer to the deleted node, leaving the caller the
responsibility of freeing memory if that is desired. Is this what we want?
</p><p>
Finally, we will summarize our homework reading on <i>circular linked lists</i>
and decide on the names of the functions we want to implement them.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
Working with your partner, use TDD to first design a test, then write code
to make your test pass until you have robust implimentations of your
assigned function. We will share our solutions and assembly them together
in class on Thursday.
</p><p>
We will be creating three new files, <code>test_clists.c</code>,
<code>clist.h</code> and <code>clist.c</code>, and then implementing the
following functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Julissa and Edward</b> will write <code>clist_length</code> and
<code>find_in_clist</code>.</li>
<li><b>Joseph and Sheel</b> will write <code>remove_from_clist</code> and
<code>clist_insert_at_index</code>.</li>
<li><b>Cyrus and Nate</b> will write <code>print_clist</code> and
<code>clist_insert_in_order</code>.</li>
</ul>
