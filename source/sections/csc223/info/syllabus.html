<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
<p>
Classes will be held each B day during the Spring 2017 semester from 11:10 AM 
to 12:30 PM in Room 102 of the

I will be available after class each day.
</p>


<h2>Course Description:</h2>
<p>
Examines fundamental data structures and analyzes algorithms. Covers abstract
data types and essential data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked
lists, and trees; introduces searching and sorting algorithms and algorithm
analysis. Prerequisites are CSC 201, Computer Science I, and MTH 173, Calculus
with Analytic Geometry I; corequisite is MTH 174, Calculus with Analytic
Geometry II. Lecture 4 hours per week.
</p>


<h2>Course Objectives:</h2>
<p>
This course is the third course for the student majoring in Computer Science.
There are four major purposes of the course. Here we begin a detailed study of
data structures and data abstraction. We continue algorithmic analysis by
examining various searching and sorting algorithms. Students study
object-oriented programming in greater depth. Finally, we continue the
development of discipline in program design, in style and expression, and in
testing and debugging. The student writes programs larger than those in the
previous course. A high-level computer language is used for the students to
implement their solutions on a computer.
</p>


<h2>Textbooks and Resource Materials:</h2>
<p>We will be using
<a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci105ssc/resources/ProblemSolvingwithAlgorithmsandDataStructures.pdf">
Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Stuctures using Python</a>,
by Brad Miller and David Ranum as our textbook.</p>


<h2>Evaluation and Grading:</h2>
<p>
Each student will earn a weekly grade based on their work in class and
their <a href="../../resources/journal.html">Problem Based Learning (PBL)
Technical Journal</a> for that week, as described in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)">rubric</a>
therein. Students are both permitted and encouraged to challenge any
evaluations with which they do not agree, but <i>only during the week
immediately following the evaluation</i>.  Evaluation grades will not be
changed after this time.
</p>


<h2>Class Policies:</h2>

<h3>Attendance:</h3>
<p>
Attendance in this class is mandatory. Students must adhere to the attendance
policy of the Arlington Public Schools. Additionally, the policy of Northern
Virginia Community College appertaining to attendance will be observed.
</p>

<h3>Classroom Conduct:</h3>
<p>
Every student must exhibit behavior which contributes to an atmosphere
conducive to teaching and learning. All Students are expected to show respect
for their classmates, the teacher and other staff members, and to be actively
engaged in learning for this course during their time in class.
</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty:</h3>
<p>
The Arlington Public School and The Northern Virginia Community College are
committed to the highest standards of academic honesty. As a result,
appropriate actions will be taken in this course to discourage breaches of
academic honesty. All work presented by the student as theirs should be the
work of that student alone.  Plagurism in any form will not be allowed.
