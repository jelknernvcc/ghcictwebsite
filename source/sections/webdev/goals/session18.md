## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand**: ü§ù The role of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and how they work together. 
- **Do**: ‚úÖ Be able to use an HTML validator. 
- **Do**: üìù Be able to create a valid HTML page. 

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As promised, we'll start the class with a quiz where you'll demonstrate that you've memorized the minimal HTML page.

### HTML Validators
We'll play with the official HTML validation service [here](https://validator.w3.org/detailed.html#validate-by-upload), then I'll share a template HTML page that automatically includes validation.

### Meet the Trifecta: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
We'll briefly discuss the three languages that make up a website: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We'll be focusing on HTML for now, but I want you to understand what HTML does, and what it leaves to CSS/Javascript.

### Independent Classwork - update your index.html homepage
The index.html page that we've written so far in your git website does not pass validation. Update your page to use my template, and write a bit more.

By the beginning of next class, I'd like everyone to have:
- An index.html page that incorporates my validation template, and passes the validation
- A link to your Markdown journal
- At least one header, using the `<h1>` tag
- Some text that introduces who you are (you can customize this, but at least give your name, grade, school, and tell about one of your interests). Use `<p>` tags as appropriate.

## Homework

### Finish Unit 1
Finish your index.html page. This is due before the beginning of next class, and I'll count it as a formative grade.

### Read the first few pages in Module 2
On our [edube.org](edube.org) class, read the first three pages in Module 2:
- Headings
- Paragraphs and Text Formatting - Part 1
- Paragraphs and Text Formatting - Part 2

There are a lot of new tags here, so I'd encourage you to make some HTML files on your own to play around with them. We'll start next class with a reading quiz where I'll expect that you're comfortable with everything introduced in these pages.
