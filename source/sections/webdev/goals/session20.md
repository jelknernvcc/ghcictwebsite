## What We'll Do In Class
Happy Halloween! We'll have a weird class today - there are some elctrical issues going on in the portables, and I'll be proctoring a test for another teacher.

For homework, you should have read about a **lot** of new html topics:
- breaks and horizontal rules
- preformatted code (inline using `<code>` and as a block using `<pre>`)
- keyboard input using `<kbd>` and output using `<samp>`
- ordered, unordered, and nested lists

## Today's Classwork

We'll skip the reading quiz today, and instead practice with some of our new HTML skills.

To do this, make a new HTML page in your repo called `code_practice.html`. In this page, write a nice html page that I might use to teach one of my lessons next year. You can choose a topic that we've covered so far this year, and produce a new HTML file that summarizes what we learned. You can start by looking at the session calendar, but I'll expect that you include more code snippets and examples.

For example, you might make an HTML page about vim - I would expect that page to include instructions about how to open/close vim, how to save files, and some of the most useful vim commands.

I'll expect that your page has:
- A list, and an unordered list, used appropriately
    - e.g. use an ordered list to give specific instruction steps, and an unordered list to provide a list of features
- A few `<pre>` / `<code>` elements, used appropriately
    - pay attention to the way that they used `&lt;` in the `<pre>` element in the page titled "Paragraphs and Text Formatting – Part 4"
- A few `<kbd>` / `<samp>` tags, used appropriately

This will be **Due** at the beginning of next class, and will count as a quiz grade.

### Read the next few pages in Module 2
On our [edube.org](https://edube.org/) text, read the next pages in Module 2:

- Tables

There are a lot of new tags here, so I'd encourage you to make some HTML files on your own to play around with them. We will not have a reading quiz next class, instead we'll practice together.
