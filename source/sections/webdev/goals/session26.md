## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Know**: Basic CSS syntax.
- **Understand**: How CSS selectors work.
- **Be Able To**: Apply CSS styles to an HTML document using element names, classes, and IDs
- **Be Able To**: Describe colors using names, RGB, and Hex.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start with a quiz that covers the last **2** reading assignments.

### Another CSS Template Example

Today, we'll again work on adding CSS to an existing website. This time, our website is for a library, and [I've posted the starter code here](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/tree/main/library)

This time, we'll care a bit more about making our website look nice. We'll play with this color palette generator: [https://palettes.shecodes.io/](https://palettes.shecodes.io/) 

We'll also discuss a new way to express colors, using Hexadecimal.

### CSS Selectors
I'll briefly introduce new CSS selectors that give us better ability to target individual HTML elements.

## Homework

### Style the Library
Commit this library example to your repo before next class. I'll grade this as a completion homework assignment. Your website should:
- Have a reasonably-nice color pallette
- Keep all styles in a single external stylesheet
- Demonstrate selectors using element name, class, and id
- Demonstrate colors using names, RGB, and Hex

### Reading
Read the next few pages in the CSS course:
- Targeting HTML ELements with Selectors
- The CSS Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance

These pages are tricky. Make sure to go through them slowly, and be prepared for a reading quiz next class!
