## What We'll Do In Class
Welcome to unit 4! This unit, we'll focus on making our websites ‚ú®beautiful‚ú® through the magic of css.

The content for this unit will be in a new course on edube. [Here's a signup link for that course](https://edube.org/enrollment/acc-webdev-css-2024).

### Favicons
First, we'll give your website a favicon, the little icon that appears in the browser tab.

Draw your own icon using this website: http://www.faviconer.com/ 

And then add it to your website using the sample code from the edube website.

### Styles: color and size
We'll work together on some simple in-line styles that make our websites look prettier.

Here are some example:


```html
<!--Set the size of an image-->
<img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Description of image" style="width:200px; height:150px;">
```

```html
<!--Set the background color of the webpage using inline styles-->
<body style="background-color: lightblue;">
```

We'll play with both of these examples.

For now, we'll stick to using [named HTML web colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors). We'll learn other ways to express colors soon!


## Homework

### Test Prep
The test will be very similar to before. Make sure you come prepared!
- Format: The test will be timed for 45 minutes. It will be mostly multiple choice questions, with two free response questions.
- You are allowed to make and use a "cheat sheet" - it must be hand written and a single page (feel free to write on the front and back)

### Reading
In the new edube css course (enrollment link is above), read the first few pages:

- Intro to the CSS Essential Course
- Introduction to CSS
- Including CSS in a Web Page
- Creating and Organizing External Stylesheets

We'll have a reading quiz on this content next time we're together (the next class after the test)
