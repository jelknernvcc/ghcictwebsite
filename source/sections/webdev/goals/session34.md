## After the test

### Course Evaluations
<p style="color: red;">
Please complete your course evaluations. To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

### CSS Grid Pixel Art
One fun way to practice with CSS grid and selectors is to create pixel art - you can create a square grid and use selectors to individually color selected squares.

For today's classwork grade, make some nice pixel art using this technique. You can [see some nice examples here](https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-css-pixel-art/), and [I wrote some starter code for you here](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/art_example.html)
