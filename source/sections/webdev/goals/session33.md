## Lesson Objectives
Welcome back! Today we'll do a bit of review, and we'll discuss the schedule for the next few weeks.


## What We'll Do In Class

## Test Prep
Next class we'll have our unit 4 test. Take some time in class today to review the content that we've learned this unit and make a cheat sheet!

Specifically, make sure that you review the readings in edube. Some of the content that we learned this unit is tricky - so make sure you review:
- Selectors (we've only done element, class, and id selectors)
- Cascade and Specificity Rules
- Box Model

Here are a few specific topics we highlighted that you should be comfortable with:
- Colors
- `background-clip` to control which parts of the box model get the background color
- properties of fonts
- Text formatting properties (text-align and text-transform)

## Polish your project
I'll start grading them at 3pm today!
