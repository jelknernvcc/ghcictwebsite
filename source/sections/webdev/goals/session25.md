## What We'll Do In Class

### No Quiz

I didn't think it would be fair to write a reading quiz on our first day back. So we'll skip the reading quiz today, and we'll include today's readings on the reading quiz next class.

### Styling the zoo website

We'll start by taking a look at our [sample zoo website](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/tree/main/zoo). We'll work on adding some styles using the `style` attribute, and then we'll discuss better ways to write stylesheets. 

### Colors
We'll talk about a better way to express colors, using the RGB color model. We'll practice using RGB values to select colors. To practice, we'll play with [RGB Color Picker](https://rgbcolorpicker.com/).

### Style the zoo website
For practice, re-download the zoo website and style it using only external stylesheets.

## Homework

### Reading
In the new edube css course (enrollment link is in session 24), read these few pages:

- Creating and organizing external stylesheets
- CSS Syntax
- CSS Comments
- Colors and Color Models (only the RGB and RGBA parts)

(note - I'm skipping the one called 'CSS Files and Directories' - we'll review that content later)

We'll have a reading quiz on this content next time we're together.
