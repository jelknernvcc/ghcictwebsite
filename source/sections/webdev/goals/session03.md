## What We'll Do In Class

Today, we'll take a break from learning about the internet and focus on developing skills with the [Unix Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) and understanding the [Directory Tree](https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unix/Unix_01_Navigation.html) using a tool called [Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html), which is a web-based game that teaches how to use the command-line - I think it's really fun! Our focus will be on understanding the practicing essential commands to create, move, and manage files and directories.

## Homework

### Part 1 - Practice with the Terminal

Use the terminal on your computer (and/or continue using Terminus) to practice with the terminal. I will expect that you are very comfortable with the structure of the directory tree (using vocabulary words like `root` and `directory`, and the special `.`, `..`, and `~` locations), and the following commands:

- **`cd` and `ls`**: You should already be comfortable with these from last class.
- **`echo`**: Create a new file and add text to it using `echo "text" > filename`.
- **`cat`**: Display the contents of a file.
- **`mkdir`**: Create new directories.
- **`rm`**: Remove files or directories you no longer need.
- **`cp`**: Copy files between directories.
- **`mv`**: Move or rename files and directories.
- **`grep`**: Search for specific text within files.
- **`less`**: View the contents of a large file.
- **`>` and `|`**: Redirect command output to a file or pipe it to another command.

Make sure you understand how each command works by trying different combinations and scenarios.

Just like today's class, I'll start the next class with a practical quiz where you will demonstrate your skills with these commands.
