### Reading Quiz
As usual, we'll start class with a reading quiz. See the previous class for details on the reading assignment.

### Project: Family Recipe Book

#### Motivation
With Thanksgiving coming up soon, we'll demonstrate all of the concepts we've learned this unit by producing a family recipe book. 

The motivation here is for you to use this project as an opportunity for you to connect with your family about recipes that are meaningful or traditional to your family. There is no need to stick to the "Thanksgiving" theme!

You might want to take a look at some recipes online for inspiration. You'll find that most recipe websites these days follow this format, which I'll expect you to reproduce:
- At the top, they have a nice picture
- They have a narrative blog-style section where they explain what they love about the recipe, what it means to their family, and any tips/tricks/substitutions that make the recipe successful
- Then they present the actual recipe, in a structured format: they list ingredients, and then step-by-step instructions

#### Project Requirements
Here's what I want the recipe book to have:

- A "homepage" that introduces your recipe book and has links to each of the recipes.
- At least two recipes, each on their own page. Each recipe should follow this format:
    - Have a nice photo of the recipe at the top (no worries if you don't have your own photo of the recipe. You're welcome to re-use an image from the internet, as long as you respect the license provided by the image's author and cite the author. You might want to use [https://search.creativecommons.org/] to find reasonable images)
    - Have an introduction at the top of the page that explains why you've selected this recipe, what significance the recipe has in your family
    - Somewhere in this introduction, include a quote from a family member
    - A sections with tips/tricks/substitutions that might make the recipe turn out well. Format these with an unordered list
    - Use a table to format the recipe itself. You'll need to list the ingredients and how much of each ingredient to use, and then instructions. In this section, also include the total preparation time and number of servings

#### Process Requirements
* This is a big project and I'll expect that you demonstrate your work. I'll look to see that your work is divided into several commits, each of which shows some of the work that you did on the project. The commits should reflect revisions. If you submit your entire project in a single commit, I will assume that you did not do the project on your own.
* Let's limit the use of styles as much as possible - the goal of this project is to focus on Semantic HTML. You may use **in-line** styling on tables like we did in class to make them easier to read.
* As always, include the validator on every HTML page. I'll expect that all pages are valid!
