## Quiz

We will **NOT** start today's class with a quiz. I know that last class's git tutorial was a lot, so we'll spend some time today going through the important parts more slowly. 

## What We'll Do In Class

We'll start by reviewing git and making sure that everyone's git website is setup successfully [see  this tutorial if you need help](https://ict.gctaa.net/resources/git_on_github/index.html). I want to make sure that everyone is very comfortable committing your code to git. We'll have a lot of practice with this today!

After some git review, we'll dive into using [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), a powerful command-line text editor that you'll find invaluable for many tasks in web development. Command-line text editors like Vim are essential because they allow you to edit files directly from the terminal, which is crucial when working on remote servers or in environments without a graphical interface. Unlike most text editors, Vim doesn't use a mouse â€” you'll rely entirely on the keyboard for navigation and editing, which can be challenging at first but is incredibly efficient once mastered.

We'll be using [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/) in class to practice the basics of Vim. This interactive tutorial will guide you through the essential commands and help you get comfortable with this tool.

Vim requires dedicated practice. I have a few suggestions of fun ways to practice:
- Install [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a Chrome extension that lets you use vim keyboard commands while you are browsing the web. I highly recommend that you install Vimium and practice using it as much as possible.
- As an alternative to Vim Tutor, you might consider trying [Open Vim](https://openvim.com/).
- In class, we'll play with [Vim Racer](https://vim-racer.com/). Keep playing this on your own and try to beat your best score.
- Check out another fun Vim game called [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/).

## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. Follow the specific instructions from [Session 2](./session.html?num=02).

If you're still working to get into your myVCCS account, follow the instructions from [Session 1](./session.html?num=01).

### Practice with Vim and Git

Please complete the entire vimtutor course, and continue practicing with Vim on your own. You should be comfortable with:
- Opening a new or existing file in Vim
- Navigating through a file using the keyboard
- Editing text, saving changes, and exiting Vim

If you need a reminder of how to make a git commit, check out [this tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/).

Next class, we'll start with another practical quiz. For this quiz, I'll ask you to use vim to add something to your `index.html` file and then commit and push.
