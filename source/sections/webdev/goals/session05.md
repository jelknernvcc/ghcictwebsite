## What We'll Do In Class

### No Quiz

We will **NOT** start today's class with a quiz. I know that last class's git tutorial was a lot, so we'll spend some time today going through the important parts more slowly. 

### Git Practice

We'll start by reviewing git and making sure that everyone's git website is setup successfully. I want to make sure that everyone is very comfortable committing your code to git. We'll have a lot of practice with this today!

### VIM

Next, we'll dive into using [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), a powerful command-line text editor that you'll find invaluable for many tasks in web development. Command-line text editors like Vim are essential because they allow you to edit files directly from the terminal, which is crucial when working on remote servers or in environments without a graphical interface. Unlike most text editors, Vim doesn't use a mouse — you'll rely entirely on the keyboard for navigation and editing, which can be challenging at first but is incredibly efficient once mastered.

We'll be using [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/) in class to practice the basics of Vim. This interactive tutorial will guide you through the essential commands and help you get comfortable with this tool.

Vim requires dedicated practice. I have a few suggestions of fun ways to practice:
- Install [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a Chrome extension that lets you use vim keyboard commands while you are browsing the web. I highly recommend that you install Vimium and practice using it as much as possible.


## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. If you need help with this, see the links in the resources section below.

### Practice with Vim and Git

Please complete the entire vimtutor course, and continue practicing with Vim on your own. Check out some of vim links in the resources section below. You should be comfortable with:
- Opening a new or existing file in Vim
- Navigating through a file using the keyboard
- Editing text, saving changes, and exiting Vim

Next class, we'll start with another practical quiz. For this quiz, I'll ask you to use vim to add something to your `index.html` file and then commit and push.
