## Quiz

We will **NOT** start today's class with a quiz. I know that last class's git tutorial was a lot, so we'll spend some time today going through the important parts more slowly. 

## What We'll Do In Class

We'll start by reviewing git. I want to make sure that everyone is very comfortable committing your code to git. We'll have a lot of practice with this today!

After some git review, we'll dive into using [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), a powerful command-line text editor that you'll find invaluable for many tasks in web development. Command-line text editors like Vim are essential because they allow you to edit files directly from the terminal, which is crucial when working on remote servers or in environments without a graphical interface. Unlike most text editors, Vim doesn't use a mouse â€” you'll rely entirely on the keyboard for navigation and editing, which can be challenging at first but is incredibly efficient once mastered.

We'll be using [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/) in class to practice the basics of Vim. This interactive tutorial will guide you through the essential commands and help you get comfortable with this tool.

Vim requires dedicated practice. One of my favorite ways to practice is to install [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a Chrome extension that lets you use vim keyboard commands while you are browsing the web. I highly recommend that you install Vimium and practice using it as much as possible!

### Key Topics:
- **Why use command-line text editors?** 
- **Introduction to Vim's modes:** Normal, Insert, and Visual
- **Basic navigation in Vim**
- **Editing and saving files without a mouse**

## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. Follow the specific instructions from [Session 2](./session.html?num=02).

If you're still working to get into your myVCCS account, follow the instructions from [Session 1](./session.html?num=01).

### Practice with Vim and Git

Please complete the entire vimtutor course, and continue practicing with Vim on your own. You should be comfortable with:
- Switching between modes (Normal, Insert, Visual)
- Navigating through a file using the keyboard
- Editing text, saving changes, and exiting Vim

If you need a reminder of how to make a git commit, check out [this tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/).

Next class, we'll start with another practical quiz. For this quiz, I'll ask you to use vim to add something to your `index.html` file and then commit and push.
