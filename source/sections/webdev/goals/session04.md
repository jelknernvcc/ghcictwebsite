## Quiz

We'll start class with a quiz that is very similar in format to the cd/ls quiz that we did last time. As before, I'll give specific instructions in class, and you'll save your terminal session to a text file for credit.

Here is a list of terminal commands that I'll include on the quiz:
- cd / ls
- mkdir
- rm
- cp
- mv
- less
- echo with > to create a text file

## What We'll Do In Class

Today, weâ€™ll be setting up GitHub accounts and learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage code. 

There are a lot of steps to this process, so [I've made a helpful tutorial for you to follow here](../../../resources/git_on_github/index.html)


## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. Follow the specific instructions from [Session 2](./session.html?num=02).

If you're still working to get into your myVCCS account, follow the instructions from [Session 1](./session.html?num=01).

### Practice with git commits

Git (ha, pun, git it?) through the Git tutorial. This was a lot, so we will not start next class with a quiz. We'll keep practicing with git next class.
