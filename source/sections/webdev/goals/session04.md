## Quiz

We'll start class with a quiz that is very similar in format to the cd/ls quiz that we did last time. As before, I'll give specific instructions in class, and you'll save your terminal session to a text file for credit.

Here is a list of terminal commands that I'll include on the quiz:
- cd / ls
- mkdir
- rm
- cp
- mv
- less
- echo with > to create a text file

## What We'll Do In Class

Today, we’ll be setting up GitHub accounts and learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage code. We'll start by making sure git is installed on your computer. Then we'll generate SSH keys with [`ssh-keygen`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen) to securely connect to GitHub. Then, we’ll cover essential Git concepts and commands including:
- Repositories
- Commits
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`

Finally, we’ll create a GitHub Pages site by uploading a simple text file as a landing page.

## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. Follow the specific instructions from [Session 2](./session.html?num=02)

### Practice with git commits

Practice adding new text to your github site. If you need a reminder of how to make a git commit, check out [this tutorial](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands/). For now, continue to use TextEdit to modify your text file. We'll learn how to modify text files at the command line next time.

As before, we'll start the next class with a practical quiz demonstrating that you know how to do this.
