## What We'll Do In Class

Today, we'll dive into using [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), a powerful command-line text editor that you'll find invaluable for many tasks in web development. Command-line text editors like Vim are essential because they allow you to edit files directly from the terminal, which is crucial when working on remote servers or in environments without a graphical interface. Unlike most text editors, Vim doesn't use a mouseâ€”you'll rely entirely on the keyboard for navigation and editing, which can be challenging at first but is incredibly efficient once mastered.

We'll be using [vimtutor](https://vimschool.netlify.app/introduction/vimtutor/) in class to practice the basics of Vim. This interactive tutorial will guide you through the essential commands and help you get comfortable with this tool.

Vim requires dedicated practice. One of my favorite ways to practice is to install [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a Chrome extension that lets you use vim keyboard commands while you are browsing the web. I highly recommend that you install Vimium and practice using it as much as possible!

### Key Topics:
