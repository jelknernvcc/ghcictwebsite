## What We'll Do In Class

Today we will discuss course objectives and class expectations.

### Communication Tools and Protocols

As an NVCC college student, the expectation is that you will use your VCCS email address to communicate with me, and that is what I want you to do. I know that you will often want to use other channels to communicate with each other for pair and group work. That's fine.

But if you want to communicate *with me* about anything, scheduling an office hour meeting to get help, expressing concerns about your grades or anything related to our class, *email me* from your VCSS email address to my VCCS email address. I will commit to check VCSS email at the start of each day, and unless unexpected circumstances arise (which I'm sure they occasionally will) to respond to you within 24 hours.

Your first homework assignment will require you to login to your VCCS account, and next class you will send me an email *from your VCSS email* answering a set of questions about your previous programming background and the goals and expectations you have for taking this course.

## Homework

### Part 1: Login to MyVCCS

As a NOVA student, it is necessary for you to access official NOVA resources. We will use this account to access one of our digital course textbooks, your NOVA email address, and many other resources. Once you login, you may not see your email yetâ€” that's okay, and I'm working through it with NOVA.

When you registered for this class, you should have created a NOVA ID and password, and your counselor may have suggested that you take a screenshot of a yellow text box with a password. You'll need to use that password to login at [my.vccs.edu](http://my.vccs.edu). You will need to login with that password and follow those instructions to set up two-factor authentication. If you have trouble with any of this, I cannot help. You will need to contact NOVA's IT support. They are available Monday - Friday: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. by calling 703.426.4141. You may also check out [their website here](https://www.nvcc.edu/about/offices/ithd/index.html).

### Part 2: Watch a video

This is your first "reading" assignment. We'll have a short, easy quiz at the beginning of next class.
