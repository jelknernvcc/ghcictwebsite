## What We'll Do In Class

Today we'll spend some time talking about how the internet works, with a focus on the [client server model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/). I will also introduce the [Unix Command Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) (it has a lot of names that I'll use interchangeably, including terminal, console,  shell, and command prompt), which is a tool we will use very frequently in this class. We'll run a few simple terminal commands that help us explore how the internet works, including [curl](https://curl.se/), [traceroute](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/traceroutes), [ping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility), [ifconfig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig). We'll also spend some time making sure everyone can login to your VCCS email address.

If you're interested in today's discussion about how people communicated before the internet, [I highly recommend this article](https://www.history.com/news/rise-fall-telephone-switchboard-operators") about the impact women had on the telephone operator role.

## Homework

### Part 1 - Write an email

**Using your VCCS email account**, send me an email to my VCCS email address: <code>cmj2310@email.vccs.edu</code> introducing yourself to me by answering the following questions. Feel free to copy/paste these questions and type your answers below the questions.

1. First - provide me with some information that I can put on a flash card. I'm going to use these flash cards to help myself learn names quicker:
    - Please include a recent picture of yourself.
    - What is your preferred name? If you are comfortable, you may also include pronouns here.
    - Share one or two facts that you want me to know about you.
2. What is your past experience with with computers, programming or web development? If you have programming experience: Which programming languages, if any, do you know? How well do you feel you know them? With which programming environments do you have experience?
3. What motivated you to sign up for this course, and what are you hoping to get out of it? Please be as specific as you can.
4. Is there anything you would like to see in a&nbsp;<em>Classroom Charter</em>&nbsp;containing the rules and norms we all agree together to abide in our learning community?

Also, download the [DE Expectations Contract](https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/webdev/info/acc_de_contract_ITD110.pdf) for this course. Review the contract and, if you agree, digitally sign it and attach it to your email. If you aren't sure how to do this, see [this guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/fill-out-and-sign-pdf-forms-prvw35725/mac).


**Due:** Get this email to me ASAP. We're still waiting for some students to get their official NOVA email accounts, so I won't set a specific due date until I know that everyone can complete this assignment.

**Evaluation**: This first assignment will count as a formative grade during the first quarter. An **A** will be earned for specific, detailed, and thoughtful answers to my questions with the photo and signed PDF attached. **B** will be earned if all questions are answered, but specific details are lacking or the photo or PDF is missing or not signed. **C** will be earned for at least answering each question, and **D** will be earned for sending me any email.

### Part 2 - Practice with the command line

Read through the instructions here: [https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/). I want you to be very comfortable using the commands `cd` and `ls`, and understanding where files are on your computer. In the terminal, practice using these two commands to move around on your computer (see the section on that page called "Moving Around the Computer").
