## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:


## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
We'll start class with a reading quiz. See our reading assignment in [Session 16](./session16.md).

### Web Development
I think you'll find writing HTML in vim much more comfortable. We'll go over a demo together to write an HTML file in vim and view it in your browser.

## Homework

### Finish Unit 1
Work through the remainder of Module 1 in [our online HTML text](https://edube.org/), and the module 1 project. This project is for your own practice and will not be graded.

### Memorize the minimal HTML page
We will start next class with a reading quiz that will look a lot like the Module 1 project. For this quiz, you will need to write an entire HTML (simple) page on your own, so you should memorize the minimal HTML page that we looked at in class today. For convenience, here it is again:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Hello World!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
