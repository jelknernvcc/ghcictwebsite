<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="standout"> 
Welcome to Website Design!
</p><p>
We'll start this week by discussing the goals and expectations for this course,
and how they fit in with the broader objectives of our computer science
and web development sequences. After that we will dive right in to learning
about the Internet.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Monday/Tuesday, August 26th/27th</h2>
<p>
Today we will discuss course objectives and class expectations.
</p>

<h3>Communication Tools and Protocols</h3>
<div>
<p>
As an NVCC college student, the expectation is that you will use your VCCS
email address to communicate with me, and that is what I want you to do. I know
that you will often want to use other channels to communicate with each other
for pair and group work. That's fine.
</p><p>
But if you want to communicate <i>with me</i> about anything, scheduling an
office hour meeting to get help, expressing concerns about your grades or
anything related to our class, <i>email me</i> from your VCSS email address to
my VCCS email address. I will commit to check VCSS email at the start of each
day, and unless unexpected circumstances arise (which I'm sure they
occassionally will) to respond to you within 24 hours.
</p><p>
Your first homework assignment will require you to send me an email
<i>from your VCSS email</i> answering a set of questions about your previous
programming background and the goals and expectations you have for taking
this course.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<div>
<p>
<i>Using your VCCS email account</i>, send me an email to my VCCS email
address: <code>cmj2310@email.vccs.edu</code> introducing yourself to me by
answering the following questions. Feel free to copy/paste these questions and type your answers below the questions.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is your past experience with with computers, programming or web development? If you have programming experience:  Which programming languages, if any, do you know?  How well do you feel you know them? With which programming environments do you have experience?</li>

<li>What motivated you to sign up for this course, and what are you hoping to get out of it? Please be as specific as you can.</li>

<li>Understanding that this will be a rigorous, challenging course, do you
feel you are interested in and dedicated to it enough to put in the time you will need to be successful?</li>

<li>Is there anything you would like to see in a <i>Classroom Charter</i> containing the rules and norms we all agree together to abide in our learning
community?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, Download the <a href="../info/acc_de_contract_ITD110.pdf">DE Expectations Contract</a> for this course. Review the contract and, if you agree, digitally sign it and attach it to your email. If you aren't sure how to do this, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/fill-out-and-sign-pdf-forms-prvw35725/mac">this guide</a>.</p>


<p style="color: red;">
<b>Due:</b> Email this assignment to me by 4 pm tomorrow so that I have time to reply before our next class. (If you are in my A day class that meets on Tuesday, email me by 4pm Wednesday. If you are in my B day class that meets on Wednesday, email me by 4pm Thursday).
</p><p>
<b>Evaluation</b>: This first assignment will count as a formative grade during first quarter. An <b>A</b> will be
earned for specific, detailed, and thoughful answers to my questions with the signed PDF attached <b>B</b>
will be earned if all questions are answered, but specific details are lacking or the PDF is missing or not signed.
<b>C</b> will be earned for at least answering each question, and <b>D</b> will
be earned for sending me any email.
