<h2>Overview</h2>
<p class="standout"> 
Welcome to Website Design!
</p><p>
We'll start this week by discussing the goals and expectations for this course,
and how they fit in with the broader objectives of our computer science
and web development sequences. After that we will dive right in to learning
about the Internet.

<h2 >Thursday August 29th, Tuesday September 3rd</h2>
    
    <h3 id="classwork">In Class Plan</h3>
    <p>Today we'll spend some time talking about how the internet works. I will also introduce the Unix Command Line (it has a lot of names that I'll use interchangeably, including terminal, console,  shell, and command prompt), which is a tool we will use very frequently in this class. We'll run a few simple terminal commands that help us explore how the internet works, including curl, traceroute, ping, ifconfig. We'll also spend some time making sure everyone can login to your VCCS email address.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in today's discussion about how people communicated before the internet, <a href="https://www.history.com/news/rise-fall-telephone-switchboard-operators">I highly recommend this article</a>about the impact women had on the telephone operator role.</p>
    <h3 id="homework-part-1-write-an-email">Homework, Part 1: Write an email</h3>
    <p><em>Using your VCCS email account</em>, send me an email to my VCCS email address:&nbsp;<code>cmj2310@email.vccs.edu</code>&nbsp;introducing yourself to me by answering the following questions. Feel free to copy/paste these questions and type your answers below the questions.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>First - provide me with some information that I can put on a flash card. I'm going to use these flash cards to help myself learn names quicker:<ul>
    <li>Please include a recent picture of yourself.</li>
    <li>What is your preferred name? If you are comfortable, you may also include pronouns here.</li>
    <li>Share one or two facts that you want me to know about you.</li></ul></li>
    <li>What is your past experience with with computers, programming or web development? If you have programming experience: Which programming languages, if any, do you know? How well do you feel you know them? With which programming environments do you have experience?</li>
    <li>What motivated you to sign up for this course, and what are you hoping to get out of it? Please be as specific as you can.</li>
    <li>Is there anything you would like to see in a&nbsp;<em>Classroom Charter</em>&nbsp;containing the rules and norms we all agree together to abide in our learning community?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Also, Download the&nbsp;<a href="https://ict.gctaa.net/sections/webdev/info/acc_de_contract_ITD110.pdf">DE Expectations Contract</a>&nbsp;for this course. Review the contract and, if you agree, digitally sign it and attach it to your email. If you aren't sure how to do this, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/preview/fill-out-and-sign-pdf-forms-prvw35725/mac">this guide</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Due:</strong>&nbsp;Email this assignment to me by 4 pm on our next school day so that I have time to reply before our next class. (If you are in my A day class that meets on Thursday, email me by 4pm Tuesday. If you are in my B day class that meets on Tuesday, email me by 4pm Wednesday).</p>
    <p style="color: red;"><strong>Evaluation</strong>: This first assignment will count as a formative grade during first quarter. An&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>&nbsp;will be earned for specific, detailed, and thoughful answers to my questions with the photo and signed PDF attached&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;will be earned if all questions are answered, but specific details are lacking or the photo or PDF is missing or not signed.&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>&nbsp;will be earned for at least answering each question, and&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>&nbsp;will be earned for sending me any email.</p>
    <h3 id="homework--part-2-practice-with-the-command-line">Homework, Part 2: Practice with the command line</h3>
    <p>Read through the instructions here:  <a href="https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/">https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/</a> . I want you to be very comfortable using the commands cd and ls, and understanding where files are on your computer. In the terminal, practice using these two commands to move around on your computer (see the section on that page called "Moving Around the Computer").</p>

<h2>Tuesday/Wednesday, August 27th/28th</h2>
<p>
Today we will discuss course objectives and class expectations.
</p>

<h3>Communication Tools and Protocols</h3>
<div>
<p>
As an NVCC college student, the expectation is that you will use your VCCS
email address to communicate with me, and that is what I want you to do. I know
that you will often want to use other channels to communicate with each other
for pair and group work. That's fine.
</p><p>
But if you want to communicate <i>with me</i> about anything, scheduling an
office hour meeting to get help, expressing concerns about your grades or
anything related to our class, <i>email me</i> from your VCSS email address to
my VCCS email address. I will commit to check VCSS email at the start of each
day, and unless unexpected circumstances arise (which I'm sure they
occassionally will) to respond to you within 24 hours.
</p><p>
Your first homework assignment will require you to login to your VCCS account, and next class you will send me an email <i>from your VCSS email</i> answering a set of questions about your previous programming background and the goals and expectations you have for taking this course.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework, part 1: Login to MyVCCS</h3>
<div>
    <p>As a NOVA student, it is necessary for you to access official NOVA resources. We will use this account to access one of our digital course textbooks, your NOVA email address, and many other resources. Once you login, you may not see your email yet - that's okay, and I'm working through it with NOVA.</p>
    <p>When you registered for this class, you should have created a NOVA ID and password, and your counselor may have suggested that you take a screenshot of a yellow text box with a password. You'll need to use that password to login at <a href="my.vccs.edu">my.vccs.edu</a>. You will need to login with that password and follow those instructions to setup two-factor authentication. If you have trouble with any of this, I cannot help. You will need to contact NOVA's IT support. They are available Monday - Friday: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. by calling 703.426.4141. You may also check out <a href="https://www.nvcc.edu/about/offices/ithd/index.html">their website here</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Homework, part 2: Watch a video</h3>
<div>
    <p>This is your first "reading" assignment. We'll have a short, easy quiz at the beginning of next class.</br>
