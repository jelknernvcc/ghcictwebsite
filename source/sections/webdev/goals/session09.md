## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- üõú Know that network traffic is not secure by default
- üòà Understand "Adversary in the middle" attacks
- üë©‚Äçüíª Understand the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- ü§´ Be able to encode and decode cryptographically secure secret messages using asymmetric encryption

### Today's Vocabulary:
- Adversary in the Middle

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
We'll start class with a short quiz on last class's homework.

### Check on your repo and StudentVue
- StudentVue was updated today. It shows everything I know. Do you have any assignments missing?
- Your github repo should contain: One Markdown journal entry, the mkdir quiz from [Session 4](session.html?num=10), an animal name.

### How secure is your web traffic?
We'll define what security means in terms of the internet, and we'll discuss some interesting implications. We'll watch a few youtube videos to help motivate this discussion:
- [Your texts are open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsvhHEz7h2k)
- [A real-life hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OVTmrXGHyU)

### Activity - Symmetric Encryption
We'll learn about "symmetric" or "shared secret" encryption, and we'll play with this website:
- [Caesar cipher Wheel](https://computerscienced.co.uk/site/caesar-cipher-wheel/caesar-cipher/)

### Activity - Asymmetric Encryption
For this activity, we'll send and receive cryptographically secure messages the same way that your terminal communicates with github - using your `id_rsa.pub` files that you created at the beginning of the year. 

You'll do this activity with a partner. Pair up with someone who sits next to you. You each will write and encode a secret message, you'll swap messages, and then you will decode the message you receive.

## Homework

### Send me an Email
Everyone has a NOVA email address now! I'll stop accepting emails at the end of this week, so go back to [Session 2](./session.html?num=02) and complete the email assignment if you haven't!



### Start preparing for our first test
We'll have our first test next week. This will cover everything that we've done this year - the terminal tools and the internet. I'll have a better study guide for you next class. In the meantime, start going through the previous lessons to jog your memory.

### We'll finish the ssh activity next time
We didn't get through this activity today, so no new reading assignment. We'll continue with it next time!
