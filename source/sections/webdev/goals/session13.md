## Note: Changes to this page
This page used to include information about how to embed equations into a Markdown file. We didn't get to that in class, so I've moved it to session14.

## What We'll Do In Class

Today, we'll start our unit 2, which will focus on (non-html) ways to make nice websites. In this unit, we'll focus on website content and design - and we'll come away with a nice understanding of the websites we'll eventually want to build with HTML.

Today's focus will be [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - we've used this for simple blog posts already, and today we'll learn how to embed tables and images. 

### Lesson Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should:
- Know how to format text, lists, and add images in Markdown
- Be able to add tables to Markdown

### Topics Covered:
- Basic Markdown: Headings, lists, links, and images
- Adding images in Markdown:
    - Syntax for embedding an image: `![Alt text](image-url)`
    - Example: `![Markdown logo](https://example.com/markdown-logo.png)`
    - Using alt text for accessibility and descriptive images


### Homework

### Markdown and Images

- If you haven't yet, finish setting up your journal. See the instructions here: [See the detailed instructions here](../projects/project.html?id=02_journal_setup)
- Add a new journal entry, where you'll summarize a lesson that you learned in a recent class. In your journal entry:
    - Include at least one image
    - Include at least one table with a heading. 
- Grading: This assignment is due by the beginning of next class (for B day, that's October 15 at 11:32AM). To get credit for this assignment, I must be able to find your journal entry by following links from your website homepage. If you write this journal somewhere else or don't link it from your homepage, you will not get credit.
    - You will get an A if you write thoughtful, complete lesson notes and meet all of the above requirements
    - You will get a B if you write thoughtful, complete lesson notes and miss any one of the above requirements, or if you attempt all and have minimal syntax errors that prevent the output from displaying correctly
    - You will get a C if you complete all of the above requirements but do not write thoughtful, complete lesson notes
    - You will get a D for writing any valid Markdown (that isn't just text)
    - You will get an E if you do not submit valid Markdown
