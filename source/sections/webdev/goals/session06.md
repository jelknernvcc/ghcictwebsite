## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- Understand the importance of Markdown formatting
- Be able to write journal entries using Markdown for your website

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As usual, we'll start with a quiz. I'll tell you something that I want you to add to your index.html. You should:
1. Use VIM to add the requested text to your index.html
2. Use git to apply the same change to your repo on github.com

While you're working today, I'll walk around and record everyone's github website URL. I'll go to your website to assign grades for this and the previous quiz.


### Class Charter
I have a draft! I'd love some feedback. [See the draft here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJwfaeJMPwO4wveRAYpc40Xwx0RQHpeF-7e4urK-Ndg/edit?usp=sharing)

### Markdown
We'll discuss [Markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) - a friendly way to write text for the web. We'll setup a Markdown journal that you'll continue to use throughout this class. We'll write our first entry, a "Hello World!" entry, together.

### Journal about command line tools
In your Markdown journal, write a journal entry. This entry should cover the terminal, git, vim, and Markdown. You should:
- Summarize the importance of each of these tools
- Share how you're feeling so far about all of this new technology
- Give advice for future students who are interested in learning them

This journal entry is due before the beginning of next class (and I'll use github commit timestamps to tell whether you submitted in time!). You will get a 100% if you use valid markdown to answer all 3 of these questions, a 90% if you answer two, an 80% if you answer one, a 70% if you post any valid Markdown, a 60% if you post anything, and a 0 otherwise.

#### If you are in my 1A Class
We didn't get to the full journal setup in this class. That's okay- everyone should have a README.md file, so I expect you to write your journal entry there. We'll finish setting up our journals later.

Remember that we'll have the HTML pre-test on Wednesday, so I expect that the journal entry will be completed by the beginning of class on Friday!

## Homework

### Send me an Email
If you haven't yet, please continue checking the myNVCC website. As soon as you see a gmail account appear, open it and send me an email. If you need help with this, see the links in the resources section below.

### Complete your journal entry about the command line
I expect that most people will finish this in class. If you don't, finish it at home!

### Read about the TCP/IP model
We'll officially start unit soon! We're officially going to "flip the classroom" now, so you'll start reading ahead. We'll have a reading quiz at the beginning of next class (for my 1A class, this will be on Friday, after the HTML pretest on Wednesday).

There are two things that I want you to read for next class:
- First, watch [This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYdF7b3nMto&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNfMRZm5DDxco3UdsFegvuB7). Specifically, I want you to understand the ideas of "packets" and "routing" that are introduced in this video.
- Read Chapter 2 of [This online textbook](https://do1.dr-chuck.net/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf). Specifically, I want you to understand the TCP/IP model, each of the four layers in the model, and the role that each plays.

If you're interested and curious, feel free to skim Chapter 1 in that book (it mostly covers concepts we've already talked about) or to watch other videos in that YouTube playlist - they're all great!
