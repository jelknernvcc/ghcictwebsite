## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- 🍰 Know the four layers of the TCP/IP model and how they relate to each-other
- 🤔 Understand the request/response cycle
- 🕸️ Understand the difference between the internet and the World Wide Web
- 🗣️ Be able to explain the steps in loading a webpage, including requests, DNS and HTTP

### Today's Vocabulary:
- TCP/IP Layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Link
- Request
- Response
- DNS
- HTTP

## What We'll Do In Class
No quiz today! I forgot to point out the reading assignment at the end of last class. If you did the reading, nice work!

Today we'll wrap up our unit about the internet by looking at the top level of the TCP/IP model, the application layer, and reviewing how the entire TCP/IP model fits together.

## Activity: The Request/Response cycle
We'll start by reviewing the four layers of the TCP/IP model (see page 14 of [Our networking textbook](https://do1.dr-chuck.net/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf)), and how they fit together, then we'll talk about a few internet applications including DNS, HTTPS, and a few others.

We'll spend some time going in depth on how the Request/Response cycle works using [Chrome's network tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network)

## Activity: Journal Setup
We'll spend some time organizing our journals. [See the detailed instructions here](../projects/project.html?id=02_journal_setup)

## Activity: Test Review
After that, I'll give you some time to review for the upcoming unit test on your own. Here is some advice:
- Format: The test will be timed for 45 minutes. It will be mostly multiple choice questions, with two free response questions.
- You are allowed to make and use a "cheat sheet" - it must be hand written and a single page (feel free to write on the front and back)
- This will be a big part of your Q1 grade. Remember - no retakes!
- Don't stress - my goal is for this to feel very similar to the learning and practice that we've done in class (you might even recognize some questions from our daily reading quizzes)
- Go through each day's web page and review the "Learning Objectives" and "Vocabulary" that I listed each day. Those sections include everything that I will expect you to know for the test
- Here's a list of terminal/git/vim topics that are fair game for the test:
    - Directory navigation: 
        - `cd`/`ls`
        - `mkdir`
    - File manipulation: 
        - `echo`
        - `>`
        - `mv`
        - `cp`
        - `rm`
    - git commands:
        - `git add`
        - `git commit -m "message"`
        - `git push`
    - vim: 
        - move the cursor around using `h/j/k/l`
        - switch into insert mode using `i` or `A`
        - switch back to normal mode using `esc`
        - quit without saving using `:q`
        - save and quit using `:wq`
- Here's some things that I won't ask you:
    - Specific markdown syntax (I need you to know what Markdown is, not its syntax)
    - How to resolve any specific errors with git or the command line
    - Any specifics about what is included in the TCP/IP packet header

## Homework

### Check on your repo and StudentVue
- Check on your StudentVue. Do you have any assignments missing? If so, don't assume that I'll notice them. Send me an email!

### Prepare for the test - don't forget to make a bring a cheat sheet!
