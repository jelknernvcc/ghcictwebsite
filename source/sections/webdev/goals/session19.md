## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:

- **Understand**: üë©‚Äçüíª The importance of semantic HTML
- **Understand**: üå≤ That the Document Object Model represents the structure of an HTML page

## What We'll Do In Class

### Quiz
As promised, we'll start the class with a quiz where you'll demonstrate that you've learned about the HTML text tags from the reading.

### Semantic HTML
We'll continue our discussion about the difference between HTML content and CSS formatting. We'll discuss [Semantic HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML) and Web Agents - computer programs that automatically read and compile information from the internet.

### Document Object Model
We'll discuss the [Document Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) - an important concept that we use to udnerstand and organize HTML pages. We'll play with [This DOM Visualizer](https://0xedward.github.io/dom-visualizer/).

### Practice
Add your favorite quote to your index.html page! Make sure to use `<q>`, `<blockquote>`, and/or `<cite>` tags appropriately!

## Homework

### Read the next few pages in Module 2
On our [edube.org](edube.org) class, read the next few pages in Module 2:

- Paragraphs and Text Formatting - Part 3
- Paragraphs and Text Formatting - Part 4
- Lists

There are a lot of new tags here, so I'd encourage you to make some HTML files on your own to play around with them. We'll start next class with a reading quiz where I'll expect that you're comfortable with everything introduced in these pages.
