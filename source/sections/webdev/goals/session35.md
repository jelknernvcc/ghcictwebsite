## New (sort of) Unit
We'll spend the next few weeks, wrapping up ITD110, playing with our new web development skills, and preparing for the final exam.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Course Evaluations
<p style="color: red;">
Please complete your course evaluations. To do that, go here:
<a href="https://nova.mce.cc">https://nova.mce.cc</a> and login: your username is your VCCS email, and your password is your 7-digit NOVA ID (which I can help you find).
NOVA really wants student participation here, and
your willingness to complete this task reflects well on your instructors, so
thank you in advance for doing it.

### Top Chef (A Day)

With the folks at your table, you'll design and create a menu website for a themed restaurant. You'll randomly draw your theme.

First - work with your table to hand-draw a menu. Decide how your menu should be divided into categories, how those categories should be laid out on the page, and then come up with a few menu items for each category.

Once your group has agreed on a page design, everyone should implement the page themselves.

At the end of the time, select one group member to share.

Use this activity to practice:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS Selectors
- Grid layouts
- Color palettes
- Font selection

### CSS Grid Pixel Art (B Day)
One fun way to practice with CSS grid and selectors is to create pixel art - you can create a square grid and use selectors to individually color selected squares.

For today's classwork grade, make some nice pixel art using this technique. You can [see some nice examples here](https://css-tricks.com/fun-times-css-pixel-art/), and [I wrote some starter code for you here](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/blob/main/art_example.html)
