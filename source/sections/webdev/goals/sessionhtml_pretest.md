## What We'll Do In Class

### HTML Pretest

#### Read this first

At the end of the school year, you'll have the opportunity to take a certification test that covers everything we're going to learn this year. We'll talk more about this certification later - but for now you should know that it's a really cool opportunity! At the beginning of the year, we're asking you to take a **pretest**. This is an old test, so it looks very similar to the real test that you'll take at the end of the year. Of course, you haven't learned any of this material yet.

I know you're looking at this pre-test and thinking, "Why am I being tested on something I haven't learned yet?" Trust me, I get it! You're not expected to ace this test, and in fact, I already know that many of the topics on it are new to you. The point of this pre-test isn’t to stress you out or to make you feel like you don’t know anything—it’s to help both you and me.

Here’s why this test matters:

1. **It’s a Starting Point**: This test gives us a clear baseline. By the end of the year, you’ll be able to see how much you've learned, and the progress you make will be visible in a way that’s hard to see day to day.
  
2. **It’s About Effort, Not Perfection**: No one expects you to get a perfect score, but the effort you put in matters. Skimming through and guessing all A’s won’t help you or me understand where you’re starting from. Try your best—there’s no pressure to get things right, just take it seriously and make educated guesses so that we can get accurate results.

3. **It's Practice for the Real Thing**: This pre-test will help you get familiar with the types of questions you’ll see later in the year. It’s not graded, but it will help reduce any surprises when you take the actual certification exam.

4. **It Helps You Learn About Yourself**: By the end of the test, you'll have a better idea of what you’ll need to focus on during the year. It’s a great tool to set personal goals and get a feel for what you’ll be learning.

So, as you take this pre-test, don’t stress about the score. Think of it as a tool for growth. Give it your best effort, and remember that this is just the beginning of your journey. The real learning starts now, and we’ll get through this together!

#### Test Instructions

This test is timed for 80 minutes. Please fill out your answers on the bubble sheet. You may rip the bubble sheet off of the rest of the packet and may write on both, but I will only grade the bubble sheet. Please write your name on both the bubble sheet and the test packet and turn in both. 

### After you finish you pretest:

#### Email me your github website

My understanding is that everyone should have a gmail account now. If you haven't yet, please complete the introductory email assignment from [Session 2](./session.html?num=02).

Regardless, send me a **new** email with a link to your github repository. I want to be able to get to everyone's repo so that I can start grading! When I get your github repo, I'll be able to put in the following grades:

- The quiz from the beginning of [Session 6](./session.html?num=06) where you added an animal name to your website. 
- Your Markdown journal entry about learning the Terminal from [Session 6](./session.html?num=06). 
- Your Terminal quiz from [Session 4](./session.html?num=04) you should have saved this quiz as a text file on your computer and then committed it to your repo.
