## A day class - read this!
I might be out for class today.

If I'm out, Jeff Elkner (in room 511) will be in charge. He'll come by to say hi and will give the reading quiz. Jeff teaches all the other CS classes here at ACC, so feel free to ask him any questions about what to take next year!

For the rest of class, work on the Library assignment described on this page. You may need to read ahead to the next CSS course page "Targeting HTML ELements with Selectors" for some of the information.


## Lesson Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should:
- **Know**: Basic CSS syntax.
- **Understand**: How CSS selectors work.
- **Be Able To**: Apply CSS styles to an HTML document using element names, classes, and IDs
- **Be Able To**: Describe colors using names, RGB, and Hex.

## What We'll Do In Class

### Reading Quiz
We'll start with a quiz that covers the last **2** reading assignments.

### Another CSS Template Example

Today, we'll again work on adding CSS to an existing website. This time, our website is for a library, and [I've posted the starter code here](https://github.com/CJonesExample/CJonesExample.github.io/tree/main/library)

This time, we'll care a bit more about making our website look nice. We'll play with this color palette generator: [https://palettes.shecodes.io/](https://palettes.shecodes.io/) 

We'll also discuss a new way to express colors, using Hexadecimal.

### CSS Selectors
I'll briefly introduce new CSS selectors that give us better ability to target individual HTML elements.

## Homework

### Style the Library
Commit this library example to your repo before next class. I'll grade this as a completion homework assignment. Your website should:
- Have a reasonably-nice color pallette
- Keep all styles in a single external stylesheet
- Demonstrate selectors using element name, class, and id
- Demonstrate colors using names, RGB, and Hex

### Reading
Read the next few pages in the CSS course:
- Targeting HTML ELements with Selectors
- The CSS Cascade, Specificity, and Inheritance

These pages are tricky. Make sure to go through them slowly, and be prepared for a reading quiz next class!
