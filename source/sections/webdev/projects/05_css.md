# Professional Website Project

## **Project Introduction**
For this project, you will demonstrate the CSS skills we’ve learned this unit by revising your github website. By the end of this project, you should have a nice, personal website to showcase your projects. This website will act as your portfolio and give you an opportunity to show off your creativity and technical skills.

You’ll apply your knowledge of CSS, including selectors, cascade, the box model, grids, and fonts, to style your site. The goal is to design a professional-looking website that reflects who you are and what you’ve accomplished.

## **Project Requirements**
Your personal website must include the following:

- **Pages:** At least two HTML pages (e.g., a homepage and a projects page).
- **CSS File:** A single external CSS file to style the website.
- **Selectors:** Use both classes and IDs to style elements.
- **Fonts:** Use at least two different fonts
    * For at least one of them, import it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 
- **Grid Layout:** Use an intentional grid layout to structure at least one of your pages.
- **Box Model:** Modify at least two elements using box model properties (e.g., padding, margin, borders).

## **Process Requirements**
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`).
- **Clean Code:** Ensure your code is properly indented, organized, and easy to read.
- **Commits:** Submit your work in multiple commits that demonstrate progress. Avoid submitting the entire project in a single commit.

## **Submission Instructions**
- I already have a link to your `index.html` homepage. That's the page that
you should be working on for this project. Any other pages you create
should be linked from that one.

|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **CSS Usage and Structure**      | CSS file is external, well-organized, and uses both classes and IDs effectively.                                    | CSS file is external but lacks organization or does not use both classes and IDs effectively. | CSS file is messy, inline styling is overused, or only IDs or classes are used.                                                          | No external CSS file provided.                |
| **Fonts and Design**             | Uses at least two fonts (including one from Google Fonts) and demonstrates a thoughtful, polished design.           | Uses two fonts but lacks intention in design or consistency.                     | Fonts are inconsistent, and no Google Font is used.                                                                                      | Fonts or styling are missing.                 |
| **Grid and Layout**              | Grid layout is intentional and enhances the design of the website.                                                  | Grid layout is present but lacks structure or clear intention.                   | Grid layout is poorly implemented or ineffective.                                                                                        | No grid layout is used.                       |
| **Box Model Adjustments**        | At least two elements are styled with thoughtful use of box model properties.                                       | Box model properties are used but inconsistently or on only one element.         | Minimal or incorrect use of box model properties.                                                                                        | No box model adjustments made.                |
| **Color Palette**                | Website uses a reasonable, consistent color palette that enhances readability and overall design.                   | Color palette is present but inconsistent or not well-suited for the design.     | Colors are jarring or make the website difficult to read.                                                                                | No intentional color palette is used.         |
| **Semantic HTML**                | Semantic HTML tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) are used consistently and appropriately.               | Semantic HTML is used but inconsistently or incorrectly.                                                               | Minimal or incorrect use of semantic HTML, making the structure unclear.                                                                | No semantic HTML is used.                     |
