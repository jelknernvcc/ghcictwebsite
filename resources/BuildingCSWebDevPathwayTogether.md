# Building an Integrated Computer Science / Web Development Pathway

## Short Description (50 words max)

This conversation will share Arlington Tech's integrated pathway to an
[Associates Degree in Computer
Science](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/computer-science.html) and a
[Career Studies Certificate in Web Design and
Development](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/web-design-and-development.html)
using [free and open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) with 
[open educational
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources), and
invite interested participants to join our development community.


## Extended Description (250 words max)

The computer science and web development programs at Arlington Tech are
building an integrated pathway to an [Associates Degree in Computer
Science](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/computer-science.html) and
a [Career Studies Certificate in Web Design and
Development](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/web-design-and-development.html)
using [free and open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and
[open educational
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

Our program design goals include both preparing students to be both:

- *college ready* to transfer successfully into a four year computer science
  program and
- *career ready* as entry-level, full-stack web developers

### Integrated Pathway

We've developed a pathway of classes with strict sequencing requirements. These
classes allow us to build on skills from one year to the next and provide
students with a diverse variety of skills and experiences.

### Open Education Resources

The CS education community has had a rough few years with commercial education
software. Multiple companies have come to market with flashy online IDEs,
encouraged teachers to build massive lesson libraries, and then remove
their K12 education support.

As an alternative to these kinds of tools, we strongly emphasize Open
Educational Resources - texts, materials, and software that are free and open
for anyone to use and modify. We've amassed a large collection of resources
developed by others, have made our own "remixes" of some, and have contributed
our own content. We are excited about this space, proud to contribute, and
eager to see our efforts used in the broader community.


## Conversational Practice (How is this a conversation?)

Since all curriculum materials in this program use **FOSS** (free and
open-source software) and are **OER** (open educational resources) the
opportunity for collaboration and conversation is baked into the cake. We are
inviting interested participants to join our curriculum development community
to help us further develop these resources together.
