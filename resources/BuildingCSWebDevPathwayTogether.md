## Extended Description (250 words max)

The computer science and web development programs at Arlington Tech are
building an integrated pathway to an [Associates Degree in Computer
Science](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/computer-science.html) and
a [Career Studies Certificate in Web Design and
Development](https://www.nvcc.edu/academics/programs/web-design-and-development.html)
using [free and open-source
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and
[open educational
resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).

Our program design goals include both preparing students to be *college ready*
to transfer successfully into a four year computer scienced program and to
be *career ready* as entry-level full-stack web developers.


## Conversational Practice (How is this a conversation?)

Since all curriculum materials in this program use **FOSS** (free and
open-source software) and are **OER** (open educational resources) the
opportunity for collaboration and conversation is baked into the cake.
