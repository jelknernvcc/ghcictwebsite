# Computer Science Faculty Interview Questions

1. How do you evaluate students' preparedness in introductory computer science
   courses and measure their computational thinking level? 

   > As a DE program we have an advantage over our non-DE NVCC colleagues -
   > our program begins with *9th grade high school students*, so the very
   > fact that they have to meet the requirements to be eligable for DE at so
   > young an age filters for students who have a solid academic background.
   > If they were not already "successful students", they would not show up
   > in our classes in the first place.

2. What learning outcomes are assessed in the NOVA computer science program?

   > We offer an A.S. Degree in Computer Science concurrent with a high school
   > diploma that has been *intentionally* integrated in its first two years
   > with a Web Design and Development IT pathway. Our goal is to provide
   > enough flexibility to serve a broader range of student interests and
   > and abilities, while at the same time creating a learning community
   > with shared knowledge, tools, and skills.
   >
   > Specifically, we offer the following sequence of courses:
   >
   > * [ITD 110: Web Page Design I](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD110)
   > * [ITD 210: Web Page Design II](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD210)
   > * [CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC221)
   > * [ITP 225: Web Scripting
   >   Languages](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITP225)
   > * [CSC 222: Object-Oriented
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC222)
   > * [Introduction to Discrete
   >   Structures](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC208)
   > * [CSC 215: Computer Systems](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC215)
   > * [CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of
   >   Algorithms](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223)
   >
   > By the end of the 2nd year of the program, we want students to be able
   > to legitimately list *full stack web developer* on their resumes, and
   > to have solid skills managing a computer from the
   > [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell), developing
   > web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the
   > [Django web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)),
   > along with the requisit skill required as a Python programmer. We assess
   > our student's Python skills by having them sit for the
   > [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) certification halfway through
   > CSC 221. This tests their ability to *read* Python. During the 2nd
   > half of the course, we focus on *writing* Python programs. We use 
   > [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which our students learn in
   > the 1st year web design courses, to have each of them create a
   > digital portfolio of their work. Git is a game changer for effective
   > evaluation of student work, since it reveals the *process* of their
   > software development as well as their product.
   >
   > The 3rd and 4th years of our sequence are focused on *demystifying the
   > computer*. We want students to leave with a firm set of skills as C++
   > programmers who can use [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) to
   > develop programs with a
   > [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
   > process. We explose them to
   > [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). As we do with Python
   > we assess student's ability to read C++ programs by having them take
   > the [CPE](https://cppinstitute.org/cpe) certification half way through
   > CSC 222.

3. How do you understand course-level objectives and their alignment with
   learning activities and assessments in your courses?

   > We are truly fortunate in having our students in a
   > [learning cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(educational_group)),
   > travelling together as a group from course to course through our
   > pathway. The importance of this fact for our program can not be
   > overstated. Students taking the same sequence of courses on campus
   > experience them as much more of a disjointed collection.
   >  
   > Since we have a small school program, with only two instructors, and
   > a cohort learning community, we were able to use
   > [backward design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design) to
   > plan a pathway fully integrated from start to finish. We know what skills
   > and experiences 2nd year students will bring from their first year with
   > us, and we can then plan accordingly.

4. What are some assessment methods you use in your classes?

   > In class paper quizzes and tests, portfolio evaluations using git
   > repositories, and class presentations are our three most commonly used
   > assesment tools for summative assessment. We use in class discussions and
   > short in class programming exercises for formative assessments. Our
   > inclusion of
   > [test-driven > development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
   > (TDD) in our curriculum provides us with a powerful tool for writing
   > formal assessments for programming, since a series of unit tests can
   > be presented to students along with the instruction to "make the tests
   > pass". This provides a clear, consise, yet open ended form of assessment.

5. How are you identifying at-risk students in your classes?

   > Again, we are keenly aware that as a DE program we have a distict
   > advantage here over our on campus colleagues. While we strive to
   > differentiate learning to reach a broad range of skills and abilities,
   > our students are all high school students who have qualified to be in
   > college courses. Participation in DE courses is currently a privilege,
   > not a right. Students who are not "college ready" are not permitted to
   > remain in our classes. The two industry certifications we use are playing
   > a very helpful role in establishing programming literacty in our students.

6. What professional development activities do you consider necessary to
   improve assessment in computer science classes?


7. How do you measure and improve students' motivation in your classes?

   > Active engagement is the most effective tool for measuring student
   > motivation. Informally this is done each day in class with classroom
   > activies and discussions. Formally we can measure engagement by looking
   > at the commit histories in student's git repositories.

8. What are your thoughts about including artificial intelligence methods to
   improve assessment in computer science classes?

   > AI scares the hell out of me!  Not sure what to say here :-(

9. What is your interest in inspiring students to seek innovation?

   > We want students to be active participants in a democratic society.
   > Innovation is how we humans engage with and transform the world we line
   > in. All people should have the right to participate in this tranformation
   > and we want our students to have the tools they need to participate.

10. How can the success rate be improved for students in computer science
    courses?

    > How about connecting the CS program with opportunities for integrated, 
    > real world, *paid* work experience?
