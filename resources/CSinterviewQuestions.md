# Computer Science Faculty Interview Questions

1. How do you evaluate students' preparedness in introductory computer science
   courses and measure their computational thinking level? 

   > As a DE program we have an advantage over our non-DE NVCC colleagues -
   > our program begins with *9th grade high school students*, so the very
   > fact that they have to meet the requirements to be eligable for DE at so
   > young an age filters for students who have a solid academic background.
   > If they were not already "successful students", they would not show up
   > in our classes in the first place.

2. What learning outcomes are assessed in the NOVA computer science program?

   > We offer an A.S. Degree in Computer Science concurrent with a high school
   > diploma.  Specifically, we offer the following sequence of courses:
   >
   > * [ITD 110: Web Page Design I](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD110)
   > * [ITD 210: Web Page Design II](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD210)
   > * [CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC221)
   > * [ITP 225: Web Scripting
   >   Languages](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITP225)
   > * [CSC 222: Object-Oriented
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC222)
   > * [Introduction to Discrete
   >   Structures](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC208)
   > * [CSC 215: Computer Systems](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC215)
   > * [CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of
   >   Algorithms](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223)
