# Computer Science Faculty Interview Questions

1. How do you evaluate students' preparedness in introductory computer science
   courses and measure their computational thinking level? 

   > As a DE program we have an advantage over our non-DE NVCC colleagues -
   > our program begins with *9th grade high school students*, so the very
   > fact that they have to meet the requirements to be eligible for DE at so
   > young an age filters for students who have a solid academic background.
   > If they were not already "successful students", they would not show up
   > in our classes in the first place.

2. What learning outcomes are assessed in the NOVA computer science program?

   > We offer an A.S. Degree in Computer Science concurrent with a high school
   > diploma that has been *intentionally* integrated in its first two years
   > with a Web Design and Development IT pathway. Our goal is to provide
   > enough flexibility to serve a broader range of student interests and
   > abilities, while at the same time creating a learning community with
   > shared knowledge, tools, and skills (see
   > https://apscs.org/index.html?school=acc).
   >
   > Specifically, we offer the following sequence of courses:
   >
   > * [ITD 110: Web Page Design I](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD110)
   > * [ITD 210: Web Page Design II](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITD210)
   > * [CSC 221: Introduction to Problem Solving and
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC221)
   > * [ITP 225: Web Scripting
   >   Languages](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/ITP225)
   > * [CSC 222: Object-Oriented
   >   Programming](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC222)
   > * [CSC 208: Introduction to Discrete
   >   Structures](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC208)
   > * [CSC 215: Computer Systems](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC215)
   > * [CSC 223: Data Structures and Analysis of
   >   Algorithms](https://courses.vccs.edu/courses/CSC223)
   >
   >
   > By the end of the 2nd year of the program, we want students to be able
   > to legitimately list *full stack web developer* on their resumes, and
   > to have solid skills managing a computer from the
   > [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell), developing
   > web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the 
   > [Django web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework)),
   > along with the requisite skill required as a Python programmer. We assess
   > our student's Python skills by having them sit for the
   > [PCEP](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep) certification halfway through
   > CSC 221. This tests their ability to *read* Python. During the 2nd
   > half of the course, we focus on *writing* Python programs. We use 
   > [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which our students learn in
   > the 1st year web design courses, to have each of them create a
   > digital portfolio of their work. Git is a game changer for effective
   > evaluation of student work, since it reveals the *process* of their
   > software development as well as their product.
   >
   > The 3rd and 4th years of our sequence are focused on *demystifying the
   > computer*. We want students to leave with a firm set of skills as C++
   > programmers who can use [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) to
   > develop programs with a
   > [Test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
   > (TDD) process. We explose them to
   > [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). As we do with Python
   > we assess student's ability to read C++ programs by having them take
   > the [CPE](https://cppinstitute.org/cpe) certification half way through
   > CSC 222.

3. How do you understand course-level objectives and their alignment with
   learning activities and assessments in your courses?

   > We are truly fortunate in having our students in a
   > [learning cohort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(educational_group)),
   > traveling together as a group from course to course through our
   > pathway. The importance of this fact for our program can not be
   > overstated. Students taking the same sequence of courses on campus
   > experience them as much more of a disjointed collection.
   >  
   > Since we have a small school program, with only two instructors, and
   > a cohort learning community, we were able to use
   > [backward design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design) to
   > plan a pathway fully integrated from start to finish. We know what skills
   > and experiences 2nd year students will bring from their first year with
   > us, and we can then plan accordingly.

4. What are some assessment methods you use in your classes?

   > In class paper quizzes and tests, portfolio evaluations using git
   > repositories, and class presentations are our three most commonly used
   > assessment tools for summative assessment. We use in class discussions and
   > short in class programming exercises for formative assessments. Our
   > inclusion of
   > TDD
   >  in our curriculum provides us with a powerful tool for writing
   > formal assessments for programming, since a series of unit tests can
   > be presented to students along with the instruction to "make the tests
   > pass". This provides a clear, concise, yet open ended form of assessment.

5. How are you identifying at-risk students in your classes?

   > Again, we are keenly aware that as a DE program we have a district
   > advantage here over our on campus colleagues. While we strive to
   > differentiate learning to reach a broad range of skills and abilities,
   > our students are all high school students who have qualified to be in
   > college courses. Participation in DE courses is currently a privilege,
   > not a right. Students who are not "college ready" are not permitted to
   > remain in our classes. The two industry certifications we use are playing
   > a very helpful role in establishing programming literacy in our students.

6. What professional development activities do you consider necessary to
   improve assessment in computer science classes?

   > We are confident that our combination of test-driven development and 
   > use of git to track student work gives us a very frequent, granular 
   > update on how well students are doing in our classes. We don't feel that we
   > need any specific PD about assessment, but we would be very excited about 
   > the opportunity to share tips/tricks/skills with other instructors.
   > Actually, we think participation in reflective research like we are doing
   > here with you now is just the kind of PD that most benefits our
   > program.


7. How do you measure and improve students' motivation in your classes?

   > Active engagement is the most effective tool for measuring student
   > motivation. Informally this is done each day in class with classroom
   > activities and discussions. Formally we can measure engagement by looking
   > at the commit histories in student's git repositories.

8. What are your thoughts about including artificial intelligence methods to
   improve assessment in computer science classes?

   > AI scares the hell out of us!  Not sure what to say here :-( When AI
   > reaches the point where it can effectively assess student learning,
   > it will soon render us as computer science instructors, and our students
   > as computer programmers about as relevant as
   > [farriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrier). We certainly need to
   > watch the developments in this incredibly rapidly developing science, and 
   > prepare ourselves for the possibily profound changes it might bring.
   >
   > In the mean time, we tell our students that it is their duty as computer
   > science students to pay attention to AI, and we encourage them to explore
   > using it while they are developing software. Currently, none of the
   > AI systems our students have access to can develop a git commit history
   > showing evidence of an iterative development process using test-driven
   > development, and they are an even longer way we assume from being able to
   > control our student's bodies to guide them in standing in front of the
   > class and presenting their software to an audience and answering questions
   > in a way that indicates understanding.  When that happens, we should all
   > practice learning to purr and hope the AIs will keep us around as pets ;-)

9. What is your interest in inspiring students to seek innovation?

   > We want students to be active participants in a democratic society and
   > thoughtful users of technology.
   > Innovation is how we humans engage with and transform the world we live
   > in. All people should have the right to participate in this transformation
   > and in the discussions about the role that technology has in our lives -
   > we want our students to have the tools they need to participate.

10. How can the success rate be improved for students in computer science
    courses?

    > How about connecting the CS program with opportunities for integrated, 
    > real world, *paid* work experience?
    > Programming is a tool that we can apply to nearly every human cause and 
    > interest - we need to find ways to connect students' interests to the
    > work they do in class.
